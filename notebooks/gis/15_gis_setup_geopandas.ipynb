                "Early in Practical Data Science, we told you that many data scientists install and manage packages using `conda` where possible rather than using tools like `pip`, `uv`, `pyenv`, etc. One of the main reasons is that data scientists often need to install lots of complex, non-Python dependencies, and `conda` does that better than lighter/faster tools like `uv`. Well, geospatial analysis is a perfect example of where `conda` shines.\n",

Behind the scenes, though, both of these libraries are mostly wrappers around a set of geospatial libraries that are used **everywhere** in the GIS world. Whether you're talking about `geopandas`, `rasterio` or stand-alone GIS tools like QGIS, all the computational heavy lifting these programs do is done by a small number of C++ and fortran libraries managed by the [OSGeo organization](https://www.osgeo.org/): [GDAL](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/gdal/) (for reading and transforming data, once upon a time called `OGR`), [GEOS](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/geos/) for geometric operations (e.g. creating unions or intersections of polygons), and [PROJ](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/proj/) for managing coordinate reference systems.\n",

In fact, even if you install with `conda` you can run into issues if you already have lots of other packages installed. So not only will we use `conda` to install these libraries, but we will also use its \"environment management\" functionality to put these installations in a clean environment we'll just use for GIS.\n",
