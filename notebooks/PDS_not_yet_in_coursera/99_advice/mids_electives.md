### Entrepreneurship & Business

- [I&E 748: New Ventures: Discover](https://entrepreneurship.duke.edu/courses-certificates/graduate-professional-courses/) <details><summary>Course Description</summary>
This course is designed to lead you to a eureka moment by teaching you how to explore the world around you for problems worth solving. Instead of jumping directly into problem solving and solution development—which can often be wasteful without a clear understanding of a given market and customer need—this course focuses on research, exploration, and discovery. It asks students to set aside pre-conceived notions, avoiding some of their own blind spots, in order to do the necessary work of collecting data about market and learning to assess it as objectively as possible. This course is ideal for anyone who wants to excel at finding white space for new innovation and entrepreneurial action.</details>
- [I&E 748: New Ventures: Deliver](https://entrepreneurship.duke.edu/courses-certificates/graduate-professional-courses/) <details><summary>Course Description</summary>
Did your idea pass muster in New Ventures Develop? Do you have early revenue or evidence of product market fit and want to continue to refine your go to market strategy? New Ventures Deliver is the ideal course for serious entrepreneurs ready to push themselves to take the leap. In this course you will continue to test core hypothesis while you develop a milestone driven plan for go-to-market, sales, staffing, and fundraising.</details>

### Machine Learning

*Note: Courses in this area are *constantly* changing, so be sure to keep an eye out for new courses!*

- COMPSCI 675D: Introduction to Deep Learning<details><summary>Course Description</summary>Provides an introduction to the machine learning technique called deep learning or deep neural networks. A focus will be the mathematical formulations of deep networks and an explanation of how these networks can be structured and 'learned' from big data. Discussion section covers practical applications, programming, and modern implementation practices. Example code and assignments will be given in Python with heavy utilization of PyTorch (or Tensorflow) package. The course and a project will cover various applications including image classification, text analysis, object detection, etc. Prerequisite: ECE 580, ECE 681, ECE 682D, Statistical Science 561D, or Computer Science 571D.</summary>
- ECE 661: Computer Engineering Machine Learning and Deep Neural Nets<details><summary>Course Description</summary>This course examines various computer engineering methods commonly performed in developing machine learning and deep neural network models. The focus of the course is on how to improve the training and inference performance in terms of model accuracy, size, runtime, etc. Techniques that are widely investigated and adopted in industrial companies and academic communities will be discussed and practiced. Programming practices on these techniques are designed with heavy utilization of the PyTorch package. Prerequisites: Computer Science 201 or ECE 551D or ECE 751D. Instructors: Y. Chen or H. Li</details>

*Editorial Comment:* An extremely difficult course. Do **not** enroll lightly or concurrently with other difficult courses.<details><summary>Course Description</summary>Students learn to program in C and C++ with coverage of data structures (linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, graphs), Abstract Data Types (Stacks, Queues, Maps, Sets), and algorithms (sorting, graph search, minimal spanning tree). Efficiency of these structures and algorithms is compared via Big-O analysis. Brief coverage of concurrent (multi-threaded) programming. Emphasis is placed on defensive coding, and use of standard UNIX development tools in preparation for students' entry into real world software development jobs. Not open to undergraduates. Instructors: Hilton, Lipp, Pastorino, or Younes</summary>
- ECE 651: Software Engineering <details><summary>Course Description</summary>Teaches students about all steps of the software development lifecycle: requirements definition, design, development, testing, and maintenance. The course assumes students are skilled object-oriented programmers from prior courses, but will include a rapid introduction to Java. Students complete team-based semester-long software project which will progress through all phases of the software lifecycle. Prerequisite: Electrical and Computer Engineering 551D or 751D. Instructors: Derby, Hilton, Noyce, Pastorino, or Rahbar</summary>
