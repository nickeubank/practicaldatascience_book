    "In the last section, we practiced using a few tools and introduced the idea that the command line is just a way of talking to your operating system using text commands rather than by clicking on icons. In this section, we'll introduce some more advanced tools, and discuss general principles that will help you during your data science career. \n",

We will not try to cover advanced bash programming (loops, function definitions, etc.), because anything you can do that way you will also be able to do in Python, for which you are receiving lots of additional training. If you want to learn the advanced bash skills, there are lots of great tutorials out there (e.g., the full [DataCamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science)). Instead, the focus here is on skills you're likely to need when using Git, managing packages in Python, or getting stuff set up on remote servers so you can run your R or Python scripts. \n",

    "## Command Line Syntax: General Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that there are some patterns to how the command line tools we've covered so far operate. In this section we'll introduce some general principles that are used by most command line programs (like `git`, `python`, `julia`, `conda`, `zip`, `ssh`, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "1:  **The first thing you type into the shell is actually just the name of a program.** This may not be obvious, but when you type `cd` and `ls`, you're actually asking your operating system to find and execute programs with those names. If you wanted to, you could actually find individual files called `cd` and `ls` that the operating system is running when you use those commands. And later on, you'll spend a lot of time using the commands `python` or `git`, which are just ways of asking the operating system to execute those programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: **The things that come after the program being called are called \"arguments,\" and they are passed to the program being called.** For example, if you were to run `python my_file.py`, you are calling the program `python` and passing it the name of a file as an argument (which it will then execute). What arguments a function accepts or requires depends on the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: **The shell is very sensitive to spaces.** If you have file names with spaces, you'll need to use quotes or escape the spaces in the file names by preceding them with a `\\` (e.g., `less this\\ is\\ my\\ file.txt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4: **Many programs have options that are activated with \"flags.\"** A flag is usually a single dash followed by a single letter. For example, you can ask the `ls` function to display the contents of a directory in a list format using the flag `-l`. "

    "Many flags also have a longer (easier to read) version that you call with **two dashes**. Basically, if a shell command sees one dash, it knows that *each letter* immediately afterwards is a different flag. If it sees two dashes, it knows that *everything after the dash before the first space* is a single flag name. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Two-dash options are common in modern commands, but they aren't always available in older commands like `cd` and `ls`. In the early days of programming, people didn't see being \"user friendly\" as a priority.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider the `less` (move) command. If you want it to report the currently installed version, you can *either* type `less -V` (single dash followed by a single letter) *or* `less --version` (double dash followed by a full word). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because a single dash tells the shell that what follows is a single-letter flag, you can actually pile up flags after a single dash. For example, we already know that `-l` tells `ls` to show files in a list. `-h` says to include a (human-readable) file size. Since each flag after a single dash is only one letter, if we squish them together, the command line knows that it's a series of one-letter flags (since `lh` itself is two letters, it wouldn't be a valid single-letter flag).

To do so, we save the output of `ls -1 *.csv` to disk (the `-1` option forces `ls` to put one file name on each line), then point `wc` at the file using the `-l` option (which counts total lines, since if a file name has a space it would be counted as multiple words.
