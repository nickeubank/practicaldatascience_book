    "Arrays of numbers are very useful tools for storing and organizing large collections of data. Often, however, we want to summarize these collections of information to provide a sense of the data as a whole. We often do this instinctively in our daily lives. For example - want to know if we're getting a good price on buying a car? Look at the average price of that care in the area and compare the asking price. Want to know if your home is at risk of being flooded? Look at the maximum flood height in the area over the past 200 years and compare that to your home. We use data summaries every day for decision-making: these are all data-driven approaches to decision-making. In other words, rudimentary data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "We touched on summarizing array information earlier when we discussed vectors. We now want to be able to summarize a collection of numerical data by calculating sums, minima, maxima, averages, standard deviations, or even counts of the number of elements in a collection. Here we'll be diving deeper into summarization techniques and will explore how they can be applied to multidimensional arrays as well. For each of these summarization techniques, `numpy` has methods that are ready to help!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your core summarization functions are as follows:\n",
    "1. Sum: `sum`\n",
    "2. Minimum: `min`\n",
    "3. Maximum: `max`\n",
    "4. Average: `mean`\n",
    "5. Median: `median`\n",
    "6. Size/Length/cardinality/number of elements: `size`\n",
    "7. Number of nonzero elements: `count_nonzero`\n",
    "8. Standard deviation: `std`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple array to demonstrate these features. (As a best practice, it's always good to start with a simple example that you can verify or compute by hand, if possible, to make sure your code is working as expected - think test-driven development as was discussed in the last course)"
