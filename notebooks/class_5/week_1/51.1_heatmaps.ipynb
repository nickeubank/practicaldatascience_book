    "So far, we have dealt solely with one-dimensional data where we have $x$ and $y$ values. However, sometimes we have functions of two variables. For example, we might be able to predict the number of sales of a  location desirability of a home (a value between 1 and 5, where 5 is a beachfront property or similar) and the area within the home in square feet. Imagine this was a simple function where $y$ is the house price, $x_1$ is the age of the home, and $x_2$ is the total floor area in the home in square feet. Imagine that relationship is shown in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Location Desirability \\ Floor area [Sq. Feet] | 0-300 | 300-600 |600-900 | 900-2500 | >2500|\n",
    "| 1 | \n",
    "| 2 |\n",
    "| 3 |\n",
    "| 4 |\n",
    "| 5 |"
