    "# Linear Regression in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many packages that implement linear regression in Python. As detailed in our last reading, however, depending on whether they are intended for use in prediction or inference, the way these packages operate can vary substantially. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, we will look at how linear regression has been implemented in two major packages — [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.org) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org). Both of these packages can fit a wide range of linear models, but the way they are organized and the results they report reflect the different audiences for whom they were designed. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Broadly speaking*, statsmodels is a library written by statisticians for statisticians, biostatisticians, social scientists, and natural scientists. It can do prediction, but its focus is *inference*, and as we will see that is reflected throughout the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn, by contrast, was written by and for computer scientists interested in machine learning. Its focus is on prediction, and while it includes a far more diverse collection of machine learning models than statsmodels, it does not include all the features someone doing inference might expect for evaluating model performance or doing things like calculating different types of standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression in statsmodels\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is the more feature-rich library when it comes to regression, we will start our exploration of linear regression in Python with statsmodels. If you have any interest in inference, are coming from a programming language like R or Stata, and/or have a background in statistics, social science, or the natural sciences, then statsmodels is the package that will feel most familiar and useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "While our focus will be on linear regression, the statsmodels package includes a wide range of tools for inference and modeling, from simple models like linear and logistic regression to generalized linear models (GLMs), non-parametric regression, robust linear models, time series models, survival analysis, multiple imputation, generalized additive models (GAMs), and more. (Curious if it includes that *one* model that's near and dear to your heart? [Feel free to go check and come back](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/user-guide.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it provides by far the easiest interface for moving from a pandas DataFrame to a regression in the Python ecosystem. To illustrate, let's fit a quick regression looking at countries' under-5 mortality rates as a function of GDP per capita and Work Bank ratings of each countries' public sector in terms of transparency, accountability, and levels of corruption:"
