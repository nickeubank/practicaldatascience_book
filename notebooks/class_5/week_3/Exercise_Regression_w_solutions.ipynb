                "These days, it is widely understood that mothers who smoke during pregnancy risk exposing their babies to many health problems. This was not common knowledge fifty years ago. One of the first studies that addressed the issue of pregnancy and smoking was the Child Health and Development Studies, a comprehensive study of all babies born between 1960 and 1967 at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, CA. The original reference for the study is Yerushalmy (1964, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, pp. 505-518). The data and a summary of the study are in Nolan and Speed (2000, Stat Labs, Chapter 10) and can be found at [the book’s website.](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/statlabs/)\n",

The researchers interviewed mothers early in their pregnancy to collect information on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, including an indicator of whether the mother smoked during pregnancy. The variables in the dataset are described in the `birthweight_codebook.txt` code book. In this exercise, we will attempt to use this data to better understand whether mothers who smoke tend to give birth to babies with lower weights than mothers who do not smoke?\n"
