Either because of clumsy data entry, bad translation between data formats, survey participants trying to be jerks, or the coding errors of other data scientists, messy data is a fact of life. As a result, a key part of being a data scientist is to learn to (a) seek out and identify data cleanliness problems, and (b) learn to correct them. \n",

    "These parts of data science are not nearly as cool or widely discussed as new machine learning packages or the latest learning algorithm, but as anyone who has done data science in the real world will tell you, data cleaning and wrangling will take up a very large portion of your working life. Indeed, it is often said that \"data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data and only 20% doing analyses\" (or, in the version I prefer, \"data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data and the other 20% of their time complaining about cleaning data.\") That's probably a little high on average—a [recent survey by Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/state-of-data-science-2020) found on average data scientists reported data wrangling took up about 45% of their time—but what is undisputed is its importance to being a successful data scientist.\n",

Since we see those appearing for respondents who are under 18, that probably means that `n/a` was filled in for all children, but that's something we'll have to investigate more. But it definitely tells us why we can't calculate the employment rate by running `(acs[\"empstat\"] == \"employed\").mean()`, since all the `n/a` values would pull down the share of respondents who are employed even though we don't consider children when calculating the employment rate!\n",
