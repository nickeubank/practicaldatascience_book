    "In data science, we often need to have a sense of the idiosyncrasies of the data, how they relate to the questions we are trying to answer, and to use that information to help us to determine what approach, such as machine learning, we may need to apply to achieve our goal. This exercise provides practice in exploring a dataset and answering question that might arise from applications related to the data.\n",

    "**Data**. The data for this problem can be found in the `data` folder. The filename is `egrid2016.xlsx`. This dataset is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)](https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid) containing information about all power plants in the United States, the amount of electricity they generate, what fuel they use, emissions produced, the location of the plant, and many more quantities. We'll be using a subset of those data.\n",

    "For more details on the data, you can refer to the [eGrid technical documents](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/documents/egrid2019_technical_guide.pdf). For example, you may want to review page 45 and the section \"Plant Primary Fuel (PLPRMFL)\", which gives the full names of the fuel types including WND for wind, NG for natural gas, BIT for Bituminous coal, etc. Codebooks for data are common in data science when the variable names would otherwise be onerously long.\n",

    "- The headers are on the second row and you'll want to ignore the first row (they're more detailed descriptions of the headers).\n",
    "- NaN values represent blanks in the data. These will appear regularly in real-world data, so getting experience working with it will be important.\n",

    "3. In what state is that plant located and what is its primary fuel?\n",
