    "## What is a Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest terms, a Series is an ordered collection of values, generally all the same type. As examples of what you can do with a series, you can have a Series that contains the ages of everyone in your class (a numeric Series), or a Series of all the names of people in your family (a string Series). \n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound familiar: isn't that how we described `numpy` vectors (i.e. one-dimensional numpy arrays)? Yes! In fact, Series are basically one-dimensional `numpy` arrays with lots of extra features added on top of them. As we'll see, almost everything you could do with a `numpy` array you can do with a Series; Series can just do *more*. In particular, the Series provides the option to use an explicit index (rather than only using the row numbers), as well as some querying and analysis tools which we'll discuss through this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series are central to `pandas` because `pandas` was designed for statistics, and Series are a perfect way to collect lots of different observations of a variable. We'll see that the apex of `pandas` functionality which is found in DataFrames is essentially a collection of Series. Understanding Series will enable you to better understand DataFrames and their value for programming for data science."

    "One of the fundamental differences between `numpy` arrays and Series is that all Series are associated with an `index`. An index is a set of labels for each observation in a Series. If you don't specify an `index` when you create a Series, `pandas` will create a default index that just labels each row with its initial row number, but you can specify an index if you want. When we explored lists and `numpy` arrays, we also encountered indices that were used to access individual elements. For 2-dimensional arrays or less, these were essentially the row numbers. These implicit indices of the row numbers are also options in Series, but there's the option to explicitly label your indices in ways that can make your data easier to analyze.\n",

In the figure below we can see the code to construct both a `numpy` array and a `pandas` Series containing the same entries, however, we can also add a1 explicit index labels that may be easier for us to read or to use to access the row contents. For example, if we were representing financial data for three days of a week: 'mon', tue', and 'wed', we may be able to do this as shown in the figure below. Once we've created our `pandas` Series, we can return a `numpy` array. If `b` contains a `pandas` Series, then we can return a `numpy` array with `b.values`."

More on that later, though...\n",

    "`pandas` Series are dynamic tools for representing a wide array of data types than (in general) `numpy` arrays. While `numpy` is the preferred tool for highly specialized numerical processing, `pandas` Series provide an important step towards understanding the representational and querying power of `pandas` for analyzing tabular data, which is an extremely common and important type of data for data scientists to work with. The Series introduces the idea of labeled and sortable indices which will enhance our ability to query our data. In the next lesson, we will explore how to work with the contents of a `pandas` Series."
