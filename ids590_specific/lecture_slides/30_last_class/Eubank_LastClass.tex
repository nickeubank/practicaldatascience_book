\pause THANK YOU!

You've...
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Measured how diplomas affect earnings (won a Nobel prize!)
    \pause \item Measured racial wage gap, racial and gender education gap, and shown how they are changing over time.
    \pause \item Documented the relationship between national income and political institutions.
    \pause \item Estimated effect of drug legalization on violent crime.
    \pause \item Measured effects of climate change in your home communities.
    \pause \item Estimated the causal effect of opioid regulatory policies.
  \end{itemize}
  \pause 
And all on the tail end of two of the hardest years.

Most important insights often come from
\begin{itemize}
  \pause \item Finding and combining new sources of data, and
  \pause \item Measuring things that haven't been measured before.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{}
\begin{center}
  You have the skills to bring evidence \\
  to bear \alert{on the questions that matter to you.}

\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
  \pause \item Work with dirty, real-world data,
  \pause \item On your own computer,
  \pause \item Even if the data is big.
  \pause \item You can also move your workflow to the cloud,
  \pause \item You have the tools to collaborate with others, get help, and contribute in the data science ecosystem.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\pause \alert{None} of these abilities depend on faculty setting up an environment for you.\\

\begin{frame}[c]{}

     \alert{Proud} and \alert{empowered}.

\begin{frame}[c]{Evaluations}
\begin{itemize}
  \pause \item \textbf{Important for me} \\
  \pause Both for improving this class, and for informing my other classes.
  \pause \item \textbf{Important to MIDS} \\
  Data $\rightarrow$ improve our teaching!
\end{itemize}
\pause So please give these your attention for the next few minutes! \\
\pause Free-response boxes are \emph{especially} helpful!
