    "# Finding Heart Rate Peaks\n",
    "\n",
    "As a researcher, one of the best parts about becoming a better programmer is that you can begin to develop your own measures of things you care about. If all you know how to do is use standard functions from standard libraries, it can be difficult to analyze data to see if it has a pattern that other people have not theorized before. \n",
    "\n",
    "But when you become a better programmer, you can decide — based on your domain knowledge, expertise, and theory — what a measure *should be*, then develop code to implement that measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be writing code to identify heart rate peaks — areas where one's heart rate hits a maximum value *in a local neighborhood*. If you care about exercise physiology, this may be of intrinsic interest to you. But if you care about a different type of research — political science, plant biology, public policy, etc. — then think of this as a chance to see how you can write bespoke code to measure whatever property of data matters to *you*.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to write the function to determine if there is a \"peak\" at a given index of a list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the videos leading up to this assignment, we will parameterize this over \"w\" which is the width of the region in which a peak has to be largest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given some index `i`, `i` is a peak within width `W` if\n",
    "   1. `i` is at least `W` (there are enough points to the left)\n",
    "   2. `i` is less than `len(data)` - `W` (there are enough points to the right)\n",
    "   3. `data[i]` is greater than the `W` values of data to its left\n",
    "        (left meaning smaller indices, `i-1`, `i-2`, ... `i-W`)\n",
    "   4. `data[i]` is greater than or equal to the `W` values of data to the right\n",
    "      (right meaning greater indices `i+1`, `i+2`, ... `i+W`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as you want ALL of the above to be true, a good approach is to\n",
    "check if any are false.  That is, your code should have this general\n",
    "structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (condition 1 is false):\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "if (condition 2 is false):\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "for j in range(1, W+1):\n",
    "        if (data[i-j] does not meet condition 3):\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        if (data[i+j] does not meet condition 4):\n",

    "return True \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to make use of list indexing for this problem. We discussed list indexing in an earlier video, but if you need a quick refresher, you can do `data[num]` where `num` is some numerical expression. This could be, for example data[0], which is the first element of the list, or `data[i]`, where `i` is some variable whose value is a number, or an arithmetic expression like `data[i+1]` or `data[i+j]` if `i` and `j` are both variables with numerical values.\n"
