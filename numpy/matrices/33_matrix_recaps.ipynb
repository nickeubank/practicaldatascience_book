                "- Like vectors, matrices are also a type of numpy array. Unlike vectors—which consist of data organized in a single dimension—matrices consist of data organized along two dimensions in a grid. \n",
                "- Like all numpy arrays, matrices are *homogenously typed*, meaning the data they hold must always be of the same type.\n",
                "- All numpy arrays consist of a single-dimensional string of data and information on how that data should be \"folded\" to create an array. A vector is just data that is not folded, while a matrix is data that is folded into a grid. \n",
                "- The shape of an array can be found in the `.shape` attribute.\n",
                "- How an array is folded can be modified with the `.reshape()` method.\n",

                "- Subsetting matrices is just like subsetting vectors, except with two entries between the square brackets instead of one: `[ , ]`.\n",
                "- The first entry in the square brackets relates to a location along the x-axis (rows), the second to the y-axis (columns).\n",
                "- You must always pass two locations to subset a matrix. If you want all rows or all columns, simply pass a `:` (e.g., to get all of the columns in the first row, you would pass `my_matrix[0, :]`).\n",
                "- Like vectors, you can subset using simple indexing using index values or ranges. This will return a view.\n",
                "- Like vectors, you can also subset with fancy indexing or a Boolean vector.\n",
                "- You can mix how you subset, and use a Boolean for rows and an index for columns.\n",
                "- Subsetting on both rows and columns allows you to edit matrices in very powerful ways. "
