To pair it with an active kernel (i.e. a running session of R), we need to right click somewhere inside the file and select \"Create Console for Editor\", then choose to open an R kernel. This will open a new window with the same name as your current text file (\"analyze_health.R\"), but with a different icon (there should be a blue box with a cursor).\n",
