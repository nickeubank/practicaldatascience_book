<h2>Write Your Calculator<a class="headerlink" href="#write-your-calculator" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We’re going to model both savings (while working) and expenditure (while retired). It turns out that both of these require the same basic information, so we will use a tuple to represent that.</p>
<p>This tuple has three fields:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>an integer “months” for the number of months it is applicable to;</p></li>
<li><p>a floating point number “contribution” for how many dollars are
contributed (or spent if negative) from the account per month;</p></li>
<li><p>a floating point number “rate_of_return” for the rate of returns
(which we will assume to be “after inflation”).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Then we will write the function:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">calculateRetirement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">start_age</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="c1">#in months</span>
                        <span class="n">initial</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="c1">#initial savings in dollars</span>
                        <span class="n">working</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="c1">#info about working</span>
                        <span class="n">retired</span><span class="p">)</span>    <span class="c1">#info about being retired</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This functions job is to print out the person’s retirement account balance in each month of their life — presumably counting up as they are working and contributing, and counting down after they retire and begin to draw down their savings. For example, a block of the output for a person who worked till 68 then retired might look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[more output cut for space]

Age  67 month  7 you have $149,6040.99
Age  67 month  8 you have $150,2651.14
Age  67 month  9 you have $150,9286.09
Age  67 month 10 you have $151,5945.91
Age  67 month 11 you have $152,2630.71
Age  68 month  0 you have $152,9340.57
Age  68 month  1 you have $152,6615.02
Age  68 month  2 you have $152,3887.20

Age  68 month  4 you have $151,8424.74

Age  68 month  6 you have $151,2953.17

Age  68 month  8 you have $150,7472.47

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, the function should return the amount of money in the retirement fund when it finishes running.</p>
<p>Given that goal, the function really has to perform two tasks (which are similar—look for a chance to abstract something out into a function!).</p>
<section id="job-1-update-balance-while-working">
<h3>Job 1: Update Balance While Working<a class="headerlink" href="#job-1-update-balance-while-working" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>First, it should compute your retirement account balance each month while you are working. To do this, you need to calculate the account balance increase from returns (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">balance</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">rate</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">return</span></code>), and add that to the current balance. You then need to add the monthly contribution to the balance.</p>
<p>For example, if you have $1,000 in the account, earn a 0.5% rate of return per month, and contribute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 per month, you would compute `1000 * 0.005 = \)</span>5` in interest earned. You would then add this plus the monthly contribution to the balance to end up with $1105 in the account at the end of the month.</p>
<p>At the start of each month (before the balance changes), you should print out the current balance with the following format helpers:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Age </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">age_in_years</span><span class="si">:</span><span class="s2">3d</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> month </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">age_in_months</span><span class="si">:</span><span class="s2">2d</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> you have $</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">balance</span><span class="si">:</span><span class="s2">,.2f</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first two format conversions are the savers age in years and months. The third format conversion is the account balance. This calculation goes on for the number of months specified in the “working” tuple. For a reminder on how f-strings work, <a class="reference internal" href="../../notebooks/other/fstrings.html"><span class="std std-doc">check here</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="job-2-update-balance-while-retired">
<h3>Job 2: Update Balance While Retired<a class="headerlink" href="#job-2-update-balance-while-retired" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Second, you should perform a very similar calculation for each month of retirement. The difference here is that you will use the information in the “retired” tuple instead of the information in the “working”
tuple. As with working, you should print out the same information as before.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> since you are performing a very similar computation, think about how you can abstract that part out into a function, and reuse it, rather than rewriting it.</p>
<p>Note that we have provided you with a main function that calls your function to do the following calculations:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Working:
--------
Months: 489
Per Month Savings: $1000
Rate of Return:  4.5% per year (0.045/12 per month) 
                [above inflation]
Retired:
--------
Months: 384
Per Month Spending: -4000
Rate of Return: 1% per year ( 0.01/12 per month) 
                [above inflation]
Starting conditions:
-------------------
Age: 327 months (27 years, 3 months)
Savings: $21,345
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We call this <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> function under</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>so that it only runs if this module is run as the main program, and not loaded as part of something else (e.g., if we load it into the grader to run other test cases!)</p>
<p>From now on, you should follow this practice.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="check-your-work">
<h2>Check Your Work<a class="headerlink" href="#check-your-work" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Run your code. The output you get should match the (very long) output pasted down below. See details on how to check it further down.</p>
</section>
<section id="submit-your-assignment">
<h2>Submit Your Assignment<a class="headerlink" href="#submit-your-assignment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Note that we will test your code with a variety of other retirement scenarios (months, initial values,
rates of return, etc).  If your code matches the local test cases but does not pass the grader, please check if you hard coded any values in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calculateRetirement</span></code> function where you should have used the values in the parameters.</p>
<p><strong>MAKE SURE YOUR <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calculateRetirement</span></code> FUNCTION RETURNS THE FINAL BALANCE AFTER ALL MONTHS OF RETIREMENT HAVE PASSED</strong></p>
<p>This returned balance should be the balance AFTER the last month, which means it will be slightly different from the last value printed.</p>
</section>
<section id="expected-output">
<h2>Expected Output<a class="headerlink" href="#expected-output" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Your function should generate the following output.</p>
<p>If this feels like too much output to check yourself, you can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">diff</span></code> function in VS Code to compare your output to this. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">diff</span></code> is an incredibly useful utility that compares two text files and only shows you the places they are different. In this case, it will show you where your results differ from the expected outputs, but the tool also becomes very useful when collaborating on code with other people — when a colleague makes a change to a big file, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">diff</span></code> makes it easy to see <em>just</em> what they’ve changed.</p>
<p>Here’s a GIF showing how you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">diff</span></code> yourself. In it, I create a text file, copy-paste the expected output into that file, open and run my python file, copy-paste the output into a second file, then as VS Code to compare the two files.</p>
<p>As you can see, only the first line is colored because in the reference text <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">world</span></code> is capitalized and in my Python output it is not. All identical lines are in grey.</p>
