    "\n",
    "As noted above, vectors can only contain one type of data, but if you try pass a list with different kinds of data to `np.array`, numpy will try and be clever and *find* a way to put all that data in one array by doing something called \"Type Promotion.\" Type promotion is the practice of converting all the data you give it to the same type. For example, if I tried to create a vector by combining a string vector and a numeric vector, numpy would convert the numeric value to a string so all the data could fit in a string vector:\n"

    "\n",
    "Indeed, there's a hierarchy of data types, where a type lower on the hierarchy can **always** be converted into something higher in the order, but not the other way around. That hierarchy is:\n",

    "`Boolean` --> `integer` --> `float` --> `string`\n",
