    "1. Begin by opening the Python file `analyze_health_and_income.py`. Does it open with appropriate syntax highlighting?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To run this file, you will need to load three packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. From the command line, use `conda` to install these packages (e.g. run `conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pick your interpreter! Python lets you select the Python installation you want to use when running Python files by clicking on the name of the currently selected Python installation along the bottom left. This will open a drop-down menu of available installations -- select your `'base': conda` installation -- this is the default conda Python installation you have setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. First, run this file (as a single file) in your normal terminal by clicking the Green Arrow in the top right of the window of your .py file. Clicking this -- rather than typing `python [filename]` in the terminal -- will ensure that VS Code runs the version of Python you have selected in the step above. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Next, select all the code in your .py file, right click and select \"Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal\". This will open the installation of Python you selected in step three and execute the lines of code you have highlighted. If you now select more lines of code and make the same selection, they will continue to be executed in the currently open Python session. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note you may also want to right-click on the top of the open Python session and click \"Move Panel Right\" if you prefer to have your open Python session running on the side rather than the bottom of your window.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, this way of interacting doesn't let you see the plot generated by this code, you just see that at the end a seaborn chart has been generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type `wdi` in your active Python session to see part of the contents of the `wdi` DataFrame. This is a table of data, but as you will see, you only get to see a small part of it in the active session. \n"

    "7. Now close that terminal session and go back to your .py file. Select the two import statements and the full multi-line `read.csv` call. Then right-click and select \"Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window\". Note that if you turned on the \"Jupyter: Send Selection To Interactive Window\" option suggested in [the video you watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1BIMbzvxFQ), you can also just hit \"Shift-Enter\". \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "8. In the bottom of the Interactive Window you will see a little console for typing code to run interactively. In that window, type `wdi`. How does this presentation of the `wdi` DataFrame compare to what you saw in the basic terminal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that by default, the system providing this augmented interactive window will only display a full DataFrame if it has <= 15 rows, but this is a setting you can change. Try running the code `pd.options.display.max_rows = 220`, then typing `wdi` again. A little overwhelming, I'll admit, but it's all there!\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Now, along the top of your interactive window is as \"Variables\" button (it may be hidden in the three dots menu). Click it. This feature is still a LITTLE buggy, so if you don't see variable, try clicking back to the Interactive window, then back to the variable list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to `wdi` is a small pop-out button. Click it. This will open your data table in an interactive window. Note you may have to move around your windows a little to see it well... \n",
    "\n",
    "You can sort (click the arrow next to a column name), or filter (type text below a column name). This is a great tool for just getting to know your data!\n",

This is a hangover from the old days when \"jupyter\" was \"ipython\", so all notebooks were IPython Notebooks. But we still use the suffix `.ipynb` even if your notebook is running a non-Python kernel (like R, Julia, etc.). This file suffix is important because seeing that suffix is what allows VS Code to know it needs to treat the document it's openning as a Jupyter Notebook. "
