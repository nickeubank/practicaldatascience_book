    "Today, we will be using the ACS data we used during out first `pandas` exercise to examine the US income distribution, and how it varies by race. Note that because the US income distribution has a very small number of people with *extremely* high incomes, and the ACS is just a sample of Americans, the far right tail of the distribution will not be very well estimated. However, this data should suffice for helping to understand wealth inequality in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, load the ACS Data we used in our first pandas exercise. That [data can be found here](https://github.com/nickeubank/MIDS_Data/tree/master/US_AmericanCommunitySurvey). We'll be working with `US_ACS_2017_10pct_sample.dta`. "

    "\n",
    "As we discussed before, the ACS uses a value of 9999999 to denote that income information is not available for someone. The problem with using this kind of \"sentinel value\" is that pandas doesn't understand that this is supposed to denote missing data, and so when it averages the variable, it doesn't know to ignore 9999999. \n",

    "### Exercise 6\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now we've been able to get a reasonable average income number. As we can see, a major advantage of using `np.nan` is that `pandas` knows that `np.nan` observations should just be ignored when we are calculating means. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it's not enough to just get rid of the people who had `inctot` values of 9999999. We also need to know why those values were missing. Suppose, for example, that the value of 9999999 was used for anyone who made more than 100,000 dollars: if we just dropped those people, then our estimate of average income wouldn't mean much, would it?\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's make sure we understand *why* data is missing for some people. If you recall from our last exercise, it seemed to be the case that most of the people who had incomes of 9999999 were children. Let's make sure that's true by looking at the distribution of the variable `age` for people for whom `inctot` is missing (i.e. subset the data to people with `inctot` missing, then look at the values of `age` with `value_counts()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then do the opposite: look at the distribution of the `age` variable for people who whom `inctot` is *not* missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you determine when 9999999 was being used? Is it ok we're excluding those people from our analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In this data, Python doesn't understand `age` is a number; it thinks it is a string because the original data has categories like \"90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)\" and \"less than 1 year old\". So you can't just use `min()` or `max()`. We'll discuss converting string variables into numbers in a future class."

    "\n",
    "But as we previously noted, there are also a lot of observations of zero income in our data, and it's not clear that we want everyone with a zero-income *should* be included in this average, since those may be people who are retired, or in school. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** these values are not quite accurate estimates. As we'll discuss in later lessons, to get completely accurate estimates from the ACS we have to take into account how people were selected to be interviewed. But you get pretty good estimates in most cases even without weightsâ€”your estimate of the racial wage gap without weights is within 5\\% of the corrected value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This is actually an underestimate of the wage gap. The US Census treats Hispanic respondents as a sub-category of \"White.\" While all ethnic distinctions are socially constructed, and so on some level these distinctions are all deeply problematic, this coding is inconsistent with what most Americans think of when they hear the term \"White,\" a term *most* Americans think of as a category that is mutually exclusive of being Hispanic or Latino (categories which are also usually conflated in American popular discussion). With that in mind, most researchers working with US Census data split \"White\" into \"White, Hispanic\" and \"White, Non-Hispanic\" using `race` *and* `hispan`. But for the moment, just identify \"White\" respondents using the value in `race`.\n",
