    "# Reshaping Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into actually doing some exercises, a few notes about reshaping in `pandas`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So many tools:** As is so often the case with `pandas`, when there are multiple ways that something can be done, `pandas` implements all of them, even it if results in a lot of duplication of funcationality. As a result, there are several sets of methods that do very similar things, and which can be hard to keep straights: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `melt` and `pivot`: Tools for moving a dataset from long-to-wide (`pivot`) or wide-to-long (`melt`).\n",
    "- `pivot_table`: Like `pivot`, but allows you to do aggregations during the reshape if you want.\n",
    "- `stack` and `unstack`: Like `melt` and `pivot`, but only for use when your variables are stored in indices. I don't use these much. \n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, **I find melt and pivot most useful.** `pivot_table` *can* do aggregations during the reshape, but you can always do aggregations yourself using `groupby`. :) \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I have to go look at [these pictures](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html)... every time I reshape. Don't hesistate to look them up for help!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What SHOULD I want my data to look like?** Just a reminder that a natural question to ask is \"in what format should I want my data?\" Obviously this question is subjective, but as you read in the Hadley Wickham [piece I assigned](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html), this is a good standard definition for a \"tidy\" dataset to which we might aspire: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each variable forms a column.\n",
    "2. Each observation forms a row.\n",
    "3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I'm a big fan of this approach, and I think it's a good one to use (especially numbers 1 and 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the question of what forms an \"observation\" depends on the analysis you plan to run (which depends on the answer you seek to ask! See! EVERYTHING ALWAYS COMES BACK TO THE QUESTION YOU ARE SEEKING TO ANSWER!). Suppose you have data on GDP from different countries for many years. If you plan to run a panel analysis where each observation is a country-year, then each row should be a country-year. But if you plan to do a country-level analysis using measures of, say, GDP variation over time, then each row should be a country!\n"

    "\n",
    "OK, that makes our data a lot more manageable, but it's still pretty heinous.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we know that we'll want to have country-years as our units of observation, so let's start reshaping. Come up with a strategy that gets our inequality variables as columns, and makes each of our future observations (i.e. each country-year) a row. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* It can sometimes be helpful to drop useless columns before a reshape.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Other hint:* Sometimes you will end up with your column names stored in a hierarchical (multi-level) `.column` object structure. As with hierarchical indices for rows, theyâ€™re a pain. (Whether this occurs depends on the exact syntax you use, so you may or may not get it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two easy ways to fix these hierarchical `.column` objects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just drop a level: df.columns.drop_level(0)` where 0 is which level you want to drop.\n",
    "- Directly manipulate the column names by doing something to the df.columns object and re-assigning to df.columns. For example, you can just concatenate two columns levels (they're stored as tuples) with a dash between them with `df.columns = map(lambda x: str(x[0]) + \"-\" + str(x[1]), df.columns)`."

Plot that relationship.\n",

    "This analysis has allowed us to evaluate whether richer countries tend to have greater income inequality, but it certainly has not established whether we should expect that as countries become wealthier, their income distribution will also become more even. In other words, we have established a correlation between income inequality and wealth, but we certainly have not established a causal relationship between wealth and income inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we might be able to get better traction on this question is to look at whether, as individual countries become wealthier, their income distribution also becomes more even.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, let's begin by subsetting our data to the years 2005 to 2015 (inclusive)â€”the period in which the largest number of countries in our data have inequality data. Then also subset for the set of countries with Gini data for all years in this period. This gives us what's called a *balanced panel*â€”a dataset in which we have data on entities *at a number of different points in time* (a panel dataset) and where at every point in time, we have data for the *same set of entities* (a balanced panel dataset). \n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced panels are very desirable because the fact that they contain the same entities at all moments in time means that any changes we measure over time are the result of real changes in the outcomes we care about and *not* the result of changes in the composition of our sample.\n",

In other words, for each country, calculate that country's average Gini score over this period and subtract that average from all of the country's Gini scores, then do the same for log GDP per capita. Then plot these countries' *demeaned* Gini scores against demeaned log GDP per capita.\n",
