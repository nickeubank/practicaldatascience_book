    "## Part 5: Dealing with Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed your first full github workflow cycle! \n",
    "\n",
    "But truthfully, that was a *very* easy cycle. In reality, there are a few problems that often crop up, so let's explore what those look like now. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common problem we face occurs when the repository you're working on changes *while you're working on your separate branch* in a way that causes conflicts. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You clone a repository, create a branch, and start making some edits to the code that correlates mortality and GDP per capita. For example, maybe you decide you want to use GDP per capita in current US dollars instead of constant 2010 US dollars.  \n",
    "- While you are making these edits, someone else comes along and modifies the code that correlates mortality and GDP per capita too. For example, suppose they decide they want to use \"Mortality rate, Under-5 (per 1,000 live births)\" instead of \"Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)\". \n",
    "- The *other* person's code gets merged into the master branch while you're still working on your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the master branch and the branch you are working on have \"diverged.\" That's because changes to the master branch don't get immediately applied to other branches, so the master branch now reflects changes that aren't present on the branch you've been working on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, *if* the specific lines of code that define what variables to use and what year to use are different lines of code, then when you go to merge your edits into the master branch (after your PR has been reviewed), then you won't have any problems. **Github considers each line of code to be a separate entity,** and so it will only compare lines of code you've modified to those in the master branch, and will just apply *only* those changes when you merge your PR. So no conflict!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, this is what happened above -- while you were working on your PR, the master branch you were working off changed when you directly edited your README file. But that didn't cause a problem for git, because it could merge in your PR by just combining (a) the changes made to README since you created your branch, and (b) the changes you've made to your data analysis file since you created your branch to create a new commit on the master branch. Those changes were made to fully independent lines of code, so they didn't conflict. \n",
    "\n",
    "**But if changes are applied to the master branch that affect the same lines of code being modified on a different branch, then you get a conflict.** For example, if the lines of code that select the year to use are the same lines of code that selects the variables to keep, then github is stuck. It knows that *since the creation of your new branch* that same line of code was edited in both your file *and* in the master branch, and it doesn't know which one is correct. If it uses your version of that line of code, then it would delete those changes to use 2015 instead of 2016; but if it uses the code on the master branch, your changes to what variables you use will be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when it happens, github throws up its hands and says \"sorry, this is above my paygrade. There's a problem here I can't solve, so I need you to do it manually\". And that's what's called a merge conflict. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to get used to merge conflicts, let's cause one! Note that both teams will have to do a bunch of steps in sequence to get this to work. "

It's *basically* like merging your current branch with the (now updated) master branch, except that it does it in a way that re-organizes the branch history so it looks like all the changes you've made in your branch occurred *after* the most recent changes that have happened in the master branch. If you're struggling with the idea of rebasing and want to learn more, [I recommend this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1wnYdLEpgI). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note it's important that you've checked out your `this_is_gonna_be_a_problem` branch before you do this! `git rebase master` says to git \"rebase the currently active branch off of master\". If the branch you have open is master, it will just announce that the rebase is done, since master is already up to date with... master (trivially!).\n",

    "![rebase](../images/rebase.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "But in this case, `rebase` will *try* and integrate your branch with the master branch, and in doing so will give you a chance to address all the conflicts that have appeared (in this case, both you and your teammates editing the first line of the README.md at the same time). \n",
    "\n",
    "When you try and rebase, you should get a message that looks something like this:\n",

    "## A Note on Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Github is both great and terrible when it comes to Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(9)** To understand why, let's begin by having everyone add and push a Jupyter Notebook to their repository. Once you've pushed your files, navigate to the notebook on github in your browser. \n",

    "The first thing you'll likely see is... nothing:\n",
    "\n",
    "![notebook_not_rendered](../images/notebook_not_rendered.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that github has service that renders jupyter notebooks to look like, well... jupyter notebooks. And when you push a jupyter notebook, that notebook gets put into a queue for rendering, and it will thus only be visible as a rendered document when it gets to the front and gets rendered. This can take a while, so we'll just move on. But if you want to see what github looks like when presented a *rendered* notebook, you can find this page as a [github-rendered notebook here!](https://github.com/nickeubank/practicaldatascience/blob/master/source/exercises/Exercise_git_2.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because the pretty version of the jupyter notebook you know and love is a *rendered* interface. If you want to see what a jupyter notebook looks like behind the scenes, click the *raw* button on the notebooks github page. *That* is actually everything that is in a jupyter notebook -- a plaintext file in JSON formatting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important to understand, because it also impacts how git manages changes to jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(9)** To illustrate, open the jupyter notebook you added to your repository and make some changes -- add some text in one cell, and maybe add a new cell. Then commit and push those changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(10)** In github, you can always easily see what has changed in a commit by clicking on the \"Commits\" button:\n",
    "\n",
    "![commits_button](../images/commits_button.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "then clicking on the hash number next to a given commit (the hash number is what uniquely identifies a commit). So in my repo, I'd click on the 829715d button:\n",
    "\n",
    "![click_the_hash](../images/click_the_hash.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That will bring you to a page that shows you a side-by-side comparison of what was in the repo before this commit, and what changed in this commit with nice coloring. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem, as you can see though, is that git interacts with jupyter notebooks at the level of those plaintext JSON formats, making diffs hard to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is for this reason that jupyter notebooks, while amazing for many things, and while fine to put into github repositories to share and host, are not great for collaborative analysis, because these diffs are just very hard to read. "

    "\n",
    "The `.gitignore` file is a way of telling git that there are certain files you just don't want in your repo. As the name implies, these can be *ignored*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because your `.gitignore` file starts with a period, it will be invisible if you aren't using a command line tool (or a program like Atom), so to modify it you need to go to the command line and run `open .gitignore` while in the root directory of your git repository. \n",

    "In that folder, you *may* see a `.gitignore` file as well, but you might not. If you do not, create one now (options: `atom .gitignore` will create a blank file called `.gitignore` and open it in atom; `nano .gitignore` will open a blank file called `.gitignore` in `nano`, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "In that file, add (as a single line in the file): `.ipynb_checkpoints/*`. \n",

    "\n",

    "As you read, Git-LFS allows you to store binary files on a server with much more storage than is available for your primary github repository. Moreover, it helps avoid the \"exploding files\" problem: if you just put a binary file in your repository, then every time you change that file and make a commit, another full version of that file is added to your git history, and that version stays with the repository. If you have a 100mb file, and modify it through 100 commits (not uncommon), then anyone who wanted to clone your repository would have to download *every one of those 100 version*, meaning they'd have to clone a 10gb file. \n",
