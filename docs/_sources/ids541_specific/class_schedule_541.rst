PDS II (IDS 541)
======================

Practical Data Science II is a flipped-classroom, exercise and project-focused course. Building on the computational thinking skills developed in Practical Data Science I, this course introduces students to a range of computational inquiry methods, including network analysis, geospatial analysis, advanced plotting, and natural language processing (NLP). Throughout, the focus will be on developing hands-on experience implementing these methods with messy real-world data to ensure students are prepared to deploy these tools to answer the questions they care about. Requirements: Practical Data Science I.
