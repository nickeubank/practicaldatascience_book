    "When it works well, the idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) is for the code you write to be *composable* — that is, like Legos, you should be able to click together different things you've built to make something that is more than the sum of its parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept, in this class you will define a `Circle` class in a manner that builds on the Point class you wrote in your [previous assignment](./60_points.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "If creating Point or Circle objects feels esoteric or silly, don't be fooled — being able to do geometric operations is key to a wide range of applications. Perhaps the most well known is geospatial analysis (often referred to as GIS, which is short for Geospatial Information Systems) — the science of understanding how things relate to one another spatially in the real world. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Point` and `Circle` objects are two of the primitives GIS analysts use on a daily basis. Points can represent anything from an election polling place to the location of a source of airborne pollution or a ship at sea. Circles (and tools for measuring overlaps between circles or circles and points) are used to identify people or animals within a given radius of a point, or an area that may be exposed to a certain intensity of radiation generated from a point. Indeed, in these exercises we're basically recreating some of the primitives used in one of the most important software libraries in the Python GIS ecosystem ([shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html))."

You can refer to it as just `Point` (like `p = Point()`). Note that if we had just said `import point` instead of `from point import Point`, you would need to write `p = point.Point()` to create a point object. \n",

As mentioned before, code that is in that `if` block is only ever executed when a file is executed directly. But at the time, what it meant to *not* execute a file directly may have been unclear. Now you know! When we run `from point import Point`, Python is running all the code in `point.py` that defines the class `Point` and its functionality so it becomes accessible inside of this `circle.py` program. But it won't run the tests at the bottom of `point.py` because that `if` statement does not evaluate to `True`.\n",

    "Remember that a question like \"what is the formula for the intersection area of two circles?\" indicates a lack of domain knowledge (not a lack of programming skill).  In such situations, you should consult an authoritative source in that domain.  For this problem, the following source derives the equation you need: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-CircleIntersection.html.\n",

    "Specifically, you need equation (14) on that page.  You can compute $cos^{-1}(x)$ with `math.acos(x)` in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the formula described above is for the case where the circles partially overlap.  You will need to determine if the circles do not overlap at all, partially overlap, or overlap completely.  If they do not overlap at all, the intersection area is 0.  If they partially overlap, use the formula above. If they overlap completely, the intersection area is the area of the smaller circle. \n",

    "We recommend drawing some pictures to figure help you figure out the algorithm to decide which case two circles fall into. \n",
