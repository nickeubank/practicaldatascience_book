    "# Defining a `Point` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will define a class called `Point`, which represents the x- and y-position of a point in the Cartesian plane. As such, it should have fields for `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need help, the Python documentation is useful: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html, especially [section 9.3](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Attributes To Define\n",
    "\n",
    "The Point class should have the following attributes and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A docstring summarizing the class.  \n",
    "- an `__init__` method, which takes parameters `x` and `y` and default initializes `x` and `y` to 0.  \n",
    "- a `move` method, which takes parameters `dx` and `dy` and moves the `x` and `y` values of the point by those amounts.  \n",
    "- `distance_from`, which takes a parameter `other_pt` and calculates its distance from the current point. \n",
    "    - Note: there are a variety of functions you might find useful in the `math` module for this, like `sqrt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dunder Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these main methods, please also define a `__str__` and a `__repr__` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you are probably starting to notice that there are quite a few of these weird things running around whose names start and end with double underscores. The `__init__` method above, for example, or the `__name__` variable in that funny `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` if statement we keep adding at the end of files. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of Python, these are referred to as \"dunder\" (short for double-underscore) methods. dunder methods are special methods that Python knows to call in special circumstances. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if someone put `()` after the name of a class name to construct a new instance of an object (e.g., `my_point = Point()`), Python will immediately look for an `__init__` method and call that.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__str__` and `__repr__` are similar. When you call `str(x)` (or put a variable in an f-string, like `f\"{x}\"`, or call `print(x)`), Python looks for a `__str__` method associated with `x` and calls that to determine what to print. If you define a `__str__` method, then users will be able to call `str(one_of_your_point_objects)` without you defining a function called `str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, `__repr__` is what Python calls if you just type the name of a variable in Python and hit enter to find out what it should print.\n",
    "\n",
    "So please also write a `__str__` and a `__repr__` method for your Point class. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your `__str__` method should return the point's coordinates as a string: `\"(1, -2)\"` for a `Point` object with coordinates`(1, -2)`. **To be clear: the `__str__` method doesn't have to print anything — it just has to return a string for Python to print. Printing strings is something Python knows how to do.**\n",
    "- Your `__repr__` method should return the Class name (in this case, `\"Point\"` and coordinates: `\"Point(1, -2)\"` for a `Point` object with coordinates`(1, -2)`. You can just use the literal word `\"Point\"` — you don't have to try and get it from an object attribute. **Again, you just need to return a string.** \n"
