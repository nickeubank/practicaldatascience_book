PDS I (IDS 590)
================

Practical Data Science I is a flipped-classroom, exercise and project-focused course. It requires zero prior experience with programming and begins with an introduction to Python, computational thinking, and the principles of good programming using the 7 Steps method. The class focus then shifts to data analysis with an emphasis on the type of analyses of interest to social scientists and public policy students. The course provides students with experience manipulating and analyzing real (often messy, error-ridden, and poorly documented) data using the full range of Python data science tools (like the command line, git, VS Code, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, and more).
