    "# Vectorization in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorizing code is a technique that will typically enable you to create faster and more readable code. Vectorization is the process of performing computation on a set of values at once instead of explicitly looping through individual elements one at a time. The difference can be readily seen in a simple example. Let's say we want to add together each element of two arrays, $a = [a_0, a_1, a_2]$ and $b = [b_0, b_1, b_2]$ such that we create a new array $c = [a_0 + b_0, a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2]$. Let's show how this is done in a non-vectorized way (using loops) and using vectorization.\n"

This approach is even clearer with 2D matrices since 2D matrices would require nested loops. In data science we are often working with vectors or matrices of data and need to perform element-wise operations on them as we discussed before, so vectorized notation is often preferable for clarity of the code. \n",

If you don't think of the most optimized approach to a problem at the start, that's okay. If you follow the practices of creating modular code and never duplicating code, you can always refactor your code later and improve its efficiency through optimization. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Get a working solution created for your problem or analysis and if it's sufficiently modular, you can optimize the performance as you identify opportunities to do so without delaying your minimum viable product."

Many of these matrix operations can be directly expressed through vectorized operations in much the same way that the math would be expressed.  For example, we often need to multiply one matrix by another - a common operation for a data scientist. We will explore in the exercises just how much more concise and readable vectorized code can be in such circumstances, and how much of an increase in speed it results in."
