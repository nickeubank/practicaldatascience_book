To answer this question, you will need to compute the proportion of all arrests in a county-year that occur within each racial group. \n",

Begin by creating a new column of data called \"violent_total\" that includes for each county and year sums violent crime arrests across all races. Hint: use `transform` to help you out.\n",

For example, there is extensive data that shows that Black and White Americans *use* drugs at the same rate, but Black Americans are arrested for drug use *much* more often. So be aware that arrests != crimes committed. Further analysis would be needed to explore those questions properly.*"
