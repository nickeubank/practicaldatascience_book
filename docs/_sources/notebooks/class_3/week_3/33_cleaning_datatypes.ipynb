    "# Cleaning Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In our past two readings, we learned about methods for cleaning our data by modifying the *values* of certain variables. But a second and extremely common data cleanliness problem pertains to managing data *types*. For example, it is very common to load data that you think *should* be numeric (say, `float64`), only to discover that pandas has loaded it as `Categorical` or `Object` type, which means you can't do numeric computations on the data (e.g., `mean`, `median`, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main reasons that this can happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are observations that are *accidentally* being parsed as non-numeric, or\n",
    "- There are observations that are *deliberately* non-numeric you didn't realize were there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is so common, let's look at a quick example of this type of problem with our old friend `world-very-small`! "

    "Here, the value is to indicate that the value of policy could be 20 *or any value above 20*. Why might this occur? In this case I've made it up, but in many surveys there will be a maximum value allowed (e.g., some surveys have a top income value they can record). These are called \"top-codes\", and they are different from the case above because it's not immediately clear what value you should put into the field. You *could* put in 20, but... the value might not be 20, it could be 21!\n",
