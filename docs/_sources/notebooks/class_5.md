# Class 5: Towards the practice of data science
- Theme: Program like a software engineer; think like a data scientist

## WEEK ONE @nickeubank

- Theme: Big data
- Learning objectives
  - Understand what makes big data big and how to work with it

### Big Data

- What makes big data big (e.g. memory hierarchy)
- Big data strategies (e.g. chunking)
- Tools for big data: dask

## WEEK TWO @kylebradbury

- Theme: Plotting and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Learning objectives: 
  - Never trust your data too much
  - Learn tools for data summarization
  - Understand the plotting ecosystem in Python
  - Understand the graphics of grammar
  - Be able to do basic plots in altair

### Plotting Principles

- Altair and its alternatives (matplotlib, plotly, etc.)
- Why Altair?
- Grammer of Graphics
- Hierarchy of encodings
- Common plot forms: scatter, line, bar, histogram, and heatmaps

### Effective plotting 

- Exploration and Exposition
- Communication and summarization
- Examples from real data sources

### Interactive plotting
- Enables rapid exploration of data and is web-friendly
- Altair can create interactive plots implicitly

## WEEK THREE

- Theme: Data Modeling
- Learning objectives: 
  - Examples of common data science applications and the programming strategies used
  - Understand common packages to be conversant in the lingua franca
  - Work through examples of each as a "hello world" of applied programming for data science

### What is Data Modelling? @kylebradbury

- Overview! "Dimensionality reduction" 
- representing data with high-fidelity
- Datasaurus / Anscombes Quartet

### Linear Regression @nickeubank

- What Is Linear Regression?
- What Are Standard Errors?
- Modelling with `statsmodels`

### Machine Learning @kylebradbury

- **What is it?**
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning
  - Supervised Machine Learning
- **scikit-learn**
  - split, fit, predict

## WEEK FOUR [assignment TBD]

- Theme: Getting Help in Learning More; Other Things
- Learning objective: 
  - Data Science is changing quickly, so you will have to keep learning constantly

### Workflows

- Data analysis v. software engineering
- don't edit your source data / data pipelines
- Collaboration on github demonstration?
- CI/CD

### Forums 

- How to post on stackoverflow
  - MWE, etiquette, problems of gender
- Posting on github

### Accessibility Tech

- Data science resources for accessibility

## WEEK FIVE [assignment / content TBD]

- Theme: Bringing it all together
- Learning objective:
  - Complete a worked example that brings together content from all 5 of the specialization courses

### Comprehensive example

- This example should include all of key practices from through out the 5 courses
- Conclude week 5 with a summary of what was learned
