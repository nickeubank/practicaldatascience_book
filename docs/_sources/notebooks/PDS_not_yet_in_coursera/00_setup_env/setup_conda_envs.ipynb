Whether you're talking about `geopandas`, `rasterio`,  or in Python; `sp`, `sf`, `raster`, or `rgeos` in R, or stand-alone tools like QGIS, the reality is that all the actual GIS work is being done by a small number of libraries (written in C++) by the [OSGeo organization](https://www.osgeo.org/): [GDAL](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/gdal/) (for reading and transforming data, once upon a time called `OGR`), [GEOS](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/geos/) for geometric operations (e.g. creating unions or intersections of polygons), and [PROJ](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/proj/) for managing coordinate reference systems.\n",
