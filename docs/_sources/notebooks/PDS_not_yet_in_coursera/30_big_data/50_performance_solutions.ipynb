    "\n",
    "The idea of `numba` is that it treats each function like it's own little program, and tries to compile it to make it faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can operate in two modes. In the first (\"python mode\"), it achieves it's speed-up by saving the machine code that was used the first time a function is run. The speed benefits of this aren't huge -- Python still has to do all the work of doing type checking and de-referencing, but it only has to actually convert what it's doing to machine code once, so if you plan on using a function over and over, it can be beneficial. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second mode (\"nopython mode\") is blazing fast. In nopython mode, `numba` analyzes your function, and then makes inferences about the types of variables that it will encounter. For example, if you gave the following code to Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_big_loop(N):\n",
    "    accumulator = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(N):\n",
    "        accumulator = accumulator + i\n",
    "    return accumulator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then you ran that code with `N=1000000`, then `numba` would look at the function and think to itself \"ok, so `N` is an integer. And `accumulator` starts as an integer. And if I add integers, they will always stay integers. So `accumulator + i` will always be integer addition. So I don't have to think about types at every stop of this loop!\n",
    "\n",
    "The only catch is that `numba` can't always compile code in `nopython` mode. For example, `numba` isn't compatible with `pandas`, so if you put `pandas` code in a function you pass to `numba`, it can't work in `nopython` mode.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But when it does work, it's magic, because instead of making a new file that has to be compiled seperately and which won't \"just work\" on other computers, to make `numba` work you just add a \"decorator\" to the function you want to speed up. For example:"

Julia is a very new language that has syntax that is *very* similar to Python, but which [runs tens or hundreds of times faster out of the box](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/). Basically, it's kinda like an entire language built around the technology also used by `numba`, but where `numba` is kind of finiky because it's been tacked on to a language that was never built for speed, Julia was designed from the ground up for speed. \n",

BUt you can write different back-end engines that *implement* these rules in different ways. \n",

    "One of these is PyPy, an implementation of Python that is designed for speed. *When it works* PyPy is about 5x faster than CPython. That means that *the same code* run in CPython (what you're using) will run about 5x slower (on average) than when run in PyPy. \n",
