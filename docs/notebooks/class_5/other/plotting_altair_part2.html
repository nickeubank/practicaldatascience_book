<h1>Advanced Plotting with Altair<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-plotting-with-altair" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>In our last reading, we introduced Altair, and explored how to make basic charts, layer and facet them, and more. In this reading, we’ll learn more about how Altair works, some of its quirks and hidden features (and how they can make your life easier), and how to generate and share interactive graphics.</p>
<section id="what-is-an-altair-chart">
<h2>What <em>is</em> an Altair Chart?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-an-altair-chart" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This may sound like a bit of an odd question to even ask – it’s it just an image?! – but in the case of Altair, it turns out the answer is a little more complicated than you might think.</p>
<p>Altair actually sits on top of a rather large stack of software libraries. Altair itself is actually just a Python wrapper for a visualization library called <a class="reference external" href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>, which is itself a simplified interface for <a class="reference external" href="https://vega.github.io/vega/">Vega</a>, which in turn is built on top of <a class="reference external" href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, a low level JavaScript visualization library.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>most</em> of that isn’t your problem, but it is helpful to know that when you create an Altair chart, what you’re <em>actually</em> generating is a JSON-formatted Vega-Lite specification for your chart. For example this chart:</p>
<p><img alt="vegalite_line" src="notebooks/class_5/other/images/vegalite_line.png" /></p>
<p>Is actually represented by this JSON file:</p>

<p>and this is then compiled into an image by javascript code <em>in your browser</em> (or in your Jupyter Notebook) to create the image you see!</p>
<p>This is important to know for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>The first is that this is the reason we need a second library – <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">altair_saver</span></code> – to save charts as PNGs, PDFs, or other image formats. If you have a chart and just run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chart.save()</span></code>, you can only save it as a JSON file or as an HTML document – we need a different library to actually render the chart into a savable image.</p>
<p>The second reason is that these Vega-Lite specifications <strong>include the data used to make the chart</strong> either explicitly or by linking to a source for the data. The reason, again, is that the chart is being generated on the fly in the browser, so the data <em>has</em> to be available at the time of compilation.</p>
<p>As a result, if you are making a chart from a large dataset, the resulting chart can become very large. Indeed, for this reason Altair will throw an error if you try and make a chart from a dataset with more than 5,000 rows, since doing so has the potential to generate pretty big files.</p>
<section id="if-you-want-to-make-a-chart-from-a-large-dataset">
<h3>If you want to make a chart from a large dataset…<a class="headerlink" href="#if-you-want-to-make-a-chart-from-a-large-dataset" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are several workarounds, depending on your use-case.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re just exploring your data:</strong></p>
<p>There are three pretty simple workarounds:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first is to just turn off this warning and ignore the problem by running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()</span></code>. If your data isn’t huge, this is just a good hack. But if you start to find that your jupyter notebook isn’t working so well any more because these are getting big, then…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the JSON data transformer by running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alt.data_transformers.enable('json')</span></code>. When you make a chart, this will cache the data to disk somewhere, then reference this file in the Vega-Lite JSON rather than writing all your data into the file. Then when your browser renders the chart, it will just read the data when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">altair_data_server</span></code> (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">altair_data_server</span></code>) and run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alt.data_transformers.enable('data_server')</span></code>. This will do the same kind of trick as above (put a reference to your data in the vega-lite spec rather than a full copy of your data), but this does it without writing anything to disk.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are good fixes if you just want to see what something looks like, or you want to generate a chart <em>and then save it as a PDF or PNG</em>. But they aren’t great for sharing / hosting online because the data isn’t actually being saved in your image.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to share your chart / host online:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Share a PDF / PNG</em> As noted above, there are lots of easy tricks if you just want to make and then export a PDF / PNG.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Collapse your data first</em> It’s pretty rare that one can create figure can really accommodate tens of thousands of data points and retain readability. So one option is to just collapse your data first! For example, if your goal is to make a bar-chart showing the number of 911 calls by day of the week, and your dataset has one million 911 calls, just collapse your data first (e.g. one row per day of the week, with the associated number of calls for each day).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Host the data at a URL</em> Vega-Lite specs need to have <em>access</em> to source data, but they don’t have to contain it per se. Indeed, if you look at the Vega-Lite JSON spec above, you can see where it points to the source data (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;data&quot;:</span> <span class="pre">{&quot;url&quot;:</span> <span class="pre">&quot;data/cars.json&quot;},</span></code>). So if your data is too big to put into the Vega-Lite spec for some reason, you can also host it elsewhere and provide a URL to the data. Just put the URL you want to use in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Chart()</span></code> when you make your chart!</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Altair Quirks &amp; Convenience Features<a class="headerlink" href="#altair-quirks-convenience-features" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>OK, enough of the nuts and bolts of Altair! Let’s dive into the little quirks and features of Altair that will make your life easier.</p>
<section id="aggregators">
<h3>Aggregators<a class="headerlink" href="#aggregators" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>As we noted in the last reading, it will often be the case that it’s easier to just do any transformations of your data <em>before</em> passing the data to Altair (in part because of the Altair data size issues noted above). But with that said, in data exploration it’s often really nice to have some quick convenience transformations, and Altair does not disappoint.</p>
<p>In particular, Altair has a small library of <a class="reference external" href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encoding.html#encoding-aggregates">aggregators</a> that can be <em>really</em> helpful for data exploration.</p>
<p>To illustrate, let’s look at some bar graphs of our WDI data:</p>

<p>Similarly, Altair also offers a few in-line data transformations, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform_regression()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform_loess()</span></code> which we saw in our last reading. The full set are <a class="reference external" href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/index.html">available here</a>. Many of these are things I can’t imagine you’d ever want in place of a simple pandas data manipulation (things like “filter” (subset) or “sample” (take a random sample), which are so easy to do in pandas), but there are a couple I like for exploratory data analysis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/regression.html#user-guide-regression-transform">transform_regression</a>: fit any one of lots of regression models to your data (though no included standard errors! :( <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/3289">Feel free to thumbs up request to add!</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/loess.html#user-guide-loess-transform">transform_loess</a>: fit a non-parametric regression model to your data (again, no standard errors :( ).</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/density.html#user-guide-density-transform">transform_density</a>: super useful for kernel densities to characterize data!</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/quantile.html">transform_quantile</a>: Good for Q-Q plots.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here’s the distribution of CO2 emissions across countries!</p>

<h2>Tidy Data: An Implicit Requirement<a class="headerlink" href="#tidy-data-an-implicit-requirement" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>You may not have noticed it, but there’s also an implicit data requirement for Altair: your dataset is organized in the <a class="reference external" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html">Tidy data</a> format.</p>
<p>Tidy data is data where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Every column is a variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Every row is an observation.</p></li>
<li><p>Every cell is a single value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As evidenced by the fact I haven’t had to explicitly say this yet, this <em>is</em> how most data scientists expect their data. But it is worth emphasizing that this is a requirement, and if you have data where, say, your columns are values (not variables), like this example from the paper linked above:</p>

</div>
<p>You’ll need to reorganize your data before using Altair so that you have a column for “religion”, a column for “income”, and a column for “number of respondents”, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">#&gt;   religion income  frequency</span>

<h2>Interactive Charts<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive-charts" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As previously noted, one of the more unique features of Altair as a plotting library is that it has inbuilt support for interactive graphics. These range from simple mouse over effects to the ability for users to make selections on one chart and observe the effects of the selections on a second.</p>
<section id="zoom-and-mouseover-effects">
<h3>Zoom and Mouseover Effects<a class="headerlink" href="#zoom-and-mouseover-effects" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The simplest but perhaps most useful form of interaction with Altair are mouseover effects – the ability for the user to zoom in, and to roll their mouse over points (e.g. in a scatter plot) and see additional information pop up.</p>
<p>To illustrate the value of this, consider the following figure from our past reading in which we wanted to overlay the names of countries on our scatterplot:</p>

<p>I <em>guess</em> this works for exploratory analysis, but it’s incredibly cluttered and almost unreadable. But what if, instead, we could make this chart so that the names of countries only popped up when you roll your mouse over a country, and where you could zoom in or out easily?</p>
<p>Well, with Altair it turns out that’s trivially easy – we add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.interactive()</span></code> to our base chart, and add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tooltip</span></code> channel to our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">encode()</span></code> function!</p>
<p>Try it – roll your scroll wheel over the plot / scroll on your mousepad, and run your mouse over different points!</p>

<p>The other useful features of interactivity is allowing users to subset the data in the figure to study different sub-populations. To do so, one has to specify two things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A “selector”: how a subset is being chosen</p></li>
<li><p>A “condition”: how the chart should respond</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate, here we create a selector (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">brush</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">alt.selection_interval()</span></code>) which will allow the user to drag a box over our chart to select a set of points.</p>
<p>Then we assign this to our plot with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.add_selection(brush)</span></code>.</p>
<p>And finally, we add a condition we assign to the color channel. The syntax of the condition is “If [first argument is true], then do [second argument], otherwise do [third argument]”. So here, when we type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">color</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">alt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">brush</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">alt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;blue&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">alt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;grey&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>we are saying “if a point is selected by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">brush</span></code>, make it blue, otherwise make it grey.</p>

<p>OK, not super interesting, I know. But it’s an easy example.</p>
<p>Now let’s do something more interesting. As you recall, we wanted the size of our points to reflect populations so we could see if big countries matched the same trend we were seeing across all countries. But we were only eye-balling things. What if we could add a population cutoff?</p>
<p>In the example below, we create a slider with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alt.binding_range</span></code>, a selector with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alt.selection_single</span></code>. Finally, we <em>bind</em> the slider to the selector, and we’re off to the races!</p>
