    "As discussed previously, because Series have both an order of rows, and labels for each row, you should always think carefully about which method of subsetting you are invoking. Given that, my advice is to always be explicit in your code and **use `.loc` (for index labels) and `.iloc` (for row numbers).** If you use these, the *only* surprising behavior to watch out for is that `loc` will align on row numbers if you pass a list or array of Booleans with no index. But since you *can't* align on an index in that case, there's no alternative behavior you would be expecting in that situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is another way to subset Series that is a little... stranger. In an effort to be easier for users, `pandas` allows subsetting using *just* square brackets (without a `.loc` or `.iloc`). With just square brackets, `pandas` will do different things depending on what you put in the square brackets. *In theory* this should always \"do what you want it to do,\" but in my experience it's a recipe for disaster. With that in mind, I don't suggest using it, but in this reading I will detail how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this makes your head swim, just remember: **you can always use `loc` and `iloc`. Single square brackets do not offer any functionality you can't get with `.loc` or `.iloc`.**\n",
