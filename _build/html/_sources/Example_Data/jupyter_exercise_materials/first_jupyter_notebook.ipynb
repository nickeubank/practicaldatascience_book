If you try and export a notebook directly to PDF, VS Code will actually try and use a tool to convert it to a LaTeX document, compile that latex document, then print, and getting this setup right can be a pain, and the LaTeX conversion often causes problems. So while a little convoluted, that's my recommendation. \n",
