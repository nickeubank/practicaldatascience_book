PDS (MIDS) (IDS 720)
=====================

A one semester version of Practical Data Science specifically tailored to Masters of Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) students. As all MIDS students complete a mandatory, 4-week, in-person, intensive summer Python programming bootcamp in August before the start of classes, this class assumes a strong foundational understanding of the Python standard library. Because this class is a one-semester class and MIDS students all take a full NLP class, it skips some topics covered in Practical Data Science II, like NLP and GIS.
