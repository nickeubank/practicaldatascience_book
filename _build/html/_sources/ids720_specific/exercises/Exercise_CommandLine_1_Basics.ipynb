    "## Navigating Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously discussed in [Command Line Basics](../command_line.ipynb), the command line is just a tool for interacting with your computer using text commands rather than by clicking around with a mouse on pictures of folders (i.e. using your Graphical User Interface, or GUI). That means that most of the principles you're familiar with (like the way files are organized into folders) apply on the command line just like in your more familiar graphical user interface. In this section, we'll briefly review how to nagivate your folder structure using the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to navigate your file system:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first **step-by-step**: analogous to how you would find a file using the operating system GUI: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check where you are currently located with the `pwd` command (short for print working directory). \n",
    "2. Use `ls` to see what folders and files are in your current directory. \n",
    "3. If the file you want to find is in one of the folders in your current directory, move into that folder with the `cd` command (e.g. `cd FOLDERNAME`). Then return to Step 2. \n",
    "4. If the file you want is *not* somewhere inside your current folder, you can move your working directory up one folder by typing `cd ..`. Then return to Step 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second is using an **absolute path**. This requires knowing the exact path of the folder where you want to work, but if you know it, you can just type `cd /THE/PATH/TO/WHERE/YOU/WANT/TO/GO`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Things to Remember**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall that if you start a path with a `/`, your are specifying an *absolute path*. When you use an absolute path, your current working directory doesn't matter. An absolute path is like a street address: it fully specifies where you want to go. For example, the absolute path to my desktop is `/users/nick/desktop`. \n",
    "- If you don't start with a `/`, you're specifying a *relative path*. Wen you use a relative path, that path is interpreted with respect to your current directory. In this sense, a relative path is like the directions you give a lost driver (\"from where we're standing, go one block north, then take a left\"). `cd FOLDERNAME`, for example, says to your computer \"I want you to make your new working directory the folder *in the current directory* named FOLDERNAME. \n",
    "- `~` is a shortcut for your user directory. If you get lost, `cd ~` will always take you back to your home directory. Also, any path that starts with `~` is actually an absolute path, even though it doesn't start with a `/` since `~` always refers to a single (absolute) location on your computer. \n",
    "- Remember that if file or folder name has a space in it, you have to put a `\\` before the space. So to move into a folder called \"My Folder\", you would type `cd My\\ Folder`. "

    "Up until now, we've just been moving around at the level of the filesystem, seeing file names but not their contents. But if a file is a plain text file, we can also look at it's contents. There are actually a few ways to do this, but the two most used options are `cat` (which will print the contents of the files to your screen), or `less` (which will open a small program to allow you to read through the document in a controlled manner). `cat` is quicker, but if you use `cat` with a big file, the whole file will just print out to your screen and you'll end up overwhelmed (though you'll be fine for a small file here).\n",

    "\n",
    "The terms \"plain text\" and \"binary\" are a little misleading since *everything* on your computer is stored as 1s and 0s (i.e. binary). What differentiates plain text and binary files is what those 1s and 0s are meant to represent. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In a plain text file,** the 1s and 0s of the file encode numbers and letters based on simple, commonly used codes (like [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) or [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). These files also do not contain anything complicated (pictures, media, etc.), and in fact don't even include information like fonts, or formatting. This simplicity makes plaintext files universally compatible, and easy to work with, so are a favorite of programmers. Any code you've ever written has probably been saved as a plaintext file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In a binary file,** by contrast, the 1s and 0s encode much more complicated information. In this case, `CE-20170824.pdf` is a PDF file that includes images, different fonts, careful formatting, etc. As a result, it can only be openned by a PDF reader (like Preview or Adobe Reader) that knows how to interprete the file's complicated content. If you open it with `less`, `less` *tries* to treat the 0s and 1s like they were just encoding simple letters and numbers, but since they don't, the result is just gobblygook. "
