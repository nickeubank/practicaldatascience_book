    "When we finished our last set of [Command Line Exercises](Exercise_CommandLine_1_basics.ipynb), we had moved all the CSVs that had data from Thursdays and Fridays into their own folder. In this exercise, we'll continue to work with that data, and we will assume that the folder currently has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`NYC_311calls_2018`: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `311_SR_Data_Dictionary_2018.xlsx`\n",
    "- `CE-20170824.pdf`\n",
    "- `NYC311_column_names.txt`\n",
    "- `README.md`\n",
    "- `raw data` [Folder containing CSVs from all days except Thursdays and Fridays]\n",
    "- `thursdays_and_fridays` [Folder containing all CSVs from Thursdays and Fridays]\n",

    "### Exercise 1: Checking Files\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing data work, it is important to always check your assumptions. For example, we *think* that we have data from every Thursday and Friday in the `thursdays_and_fridays` directory. But are we sure?\n",
    "\n",
    "To check, let's quickly google \"how many thursdays were there in 2018\" and \"how many fridays were there in 2018\" (there are 52 weeks in a year so it's probably 52 of each, but important to be sure as 365 is not evenly divided by 52). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then let's count the number of files we have in the `thursdays_and_fridays` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: to do this, we need one command to list out the names of all the files in `thursdays_and_fridays` (`ls`), a second command to count the number of files reported (`wc`), and some way to pass data from one to the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second hint: you probably want to use the `1` flag for `ls`. The `1` flag tells `ls` to make sure it only prints one file name per line. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have trouble interpreting the output you get, you might have to check the `wc` documentation. "

    "### Exercise 2: Combining files\n",
    "\n",
    "Having all these individual files is not very efficient. Instead, we'd like to merge all these files into a single large CSV file we can import into Python and analyze. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall, the `cat` command is often used to print the contents of a file out to the screen. But `cat` actually stands for concatenate: if you give the command multiple files, it will join them together one after the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `cat` to merge all the files in `thursdays_and_fridays` into a single CSV called `thursdays_and_fridays.csv` saved to disk. "

    "### Exercise 3: Viewing your Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now we have a single CSV file with all our data for Thursdays and Fridays. But there's a problem: none of the columns are labele!.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Take a look at the first few lines of our merged CSV file using either `less` or `head`.** Head is a new tool! It's like `cat` in that it just prints the contents of a file to the screen, but unlike `cat` it only prints a few lines. There's also a command called `tail` that shows you the last few lines of a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Try also confirming this by openning `thursdays_and_fridays.csv` in Excel.** As you will discover, it's a very slow process. This is another advantage of the command line: when working with big files, being able to quickly look at a few lines of a file in the command line is very efficient."
