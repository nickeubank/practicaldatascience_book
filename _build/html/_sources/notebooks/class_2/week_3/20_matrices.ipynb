                "There are (at least) four reasons to learn about matrices as a data scientist. The first is that a matrix is one of the standard ways that we organize tabular data -- data where each row is a different *observation* or *individual unit* we are studying, and each column is a different property about which we have data for those observations. So we'll use matrices directly a lot. \n",
                "\n",
                "The second is that matrices are a natural steppingstone from vectors to arrays of arbitrary dimension (N-D arrays), as well as another data structure we'll work with a lot: pandas `DataFrames`. So everything we learn here will be immediately applicable in our following lessons.\n",
                "\n",
                "The third is that matrices are also the standard way we represent image data, which is also commonly used by data scientists interested in computer vision and image processing. A picture is just a grid of pixels, each containing information about the color containing in that pixel. Matrices are the natural way to represent this type of gridded data, so as we'll see below we can easily represent images as matrices. \n",
                "\n",
                "And the fourth reason is that matrices (and linear algebra, the mathematics of matrices) underlie nearly all the statistical models that we use in data science (like linear regression, logistic regression models, SVMs, etc.). So when we begin to work with statistics and machine learning packages, matrices will be inescapable."

For example, here we can create the matrix of survey responses we talked about above by putting each row into a list, then putting those lists into a bigger list and passing it to `np.array`.
