    "# Exercise 1: Replacing the outliers to save your data\n",
    "Missing or erroneous data come in a wide variety of forms. Sometimes you may encounter a dataset that has blanks where numbers should appear. Depending on how the dataset was created or if it was digitized, the blanks could be in the form of a null string (e.g. \"\"), a not applicable string (e.g. \"N/A\" or \"NAN\"), or sometimes a unique value (e.g. \"missing\", \"unavailable\"). In some cases, when the data need to be in certain forms, such as when the data must be numerical, the data may be entered as unique codes corresponding to missing or erroneous values. The assigned value is generally something outside of the realm of expected values (much higher or lower) so that it is clear to whoever reads the data that the entry was not meant as actual data. For example, if we had a dataset listing the number of children in each household in a village, we would likely raise an eyebrow if we saw the number 88888; it's probably missing or erroneous data. For data that is typically large sometimes 0 is used&emdash;if we had a dataset of personal weight in kilograms and we saw a 0 value, that would likely raise a red flag. Erroneous data can sometimes be a bit trickier to identify because it could be due to an unintentional mistake and may fail silently: e.g. hitting an extra keystroke on data entry or missing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if we can clean up some missing data. Imagine you are the record keeper for a local municipality that has 500 citizens aged 55 and over. The town is known for its longevity and you've been asked by a team of researchers to identify the oldest citizen in town. The problem is, the records are occasionally in error and in those cases, an age of 999 is entered instead of the correct age. Remove the erroneous data from the array and determine the age of the oldest citizen.\n",

    "6. We often want to monitor and understand regional changes in poverty so we can learn from their experiences. It's useful to understand regions that have reduced the prevalence of poverty and those in which poverty has increased, in both cases to learn from what drove those changes and to work towards remediating extreme poverty wherever possible. To that end, we want to know which parts of the world experienced the largest change in the percentage of its population in extreme poverty. Since we've already explored the trends in poverty, calculate the change in the percentage of those in extreme poverty by computing the difference between the maximum and minimum percentages. Which region experienced the largest change? Which experienced the smallest change? Were those trends increasing or decreasing (how do you know based on what you've investigated so far)?"
