    "In recent years, many US states have decided to legalize the use of marijuana. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these ideas were first proposed, there were many theories about the relationship between crime and the \"War on Drugs\" (the term given to US efforts to arrest drug users and dealers over the past several decades). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to test a few of those theories using drug arrest data from the state of California.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: this is one of the most ambitious exercises in this Coursera course! It is quite involved, and requires you to think not just about how to get your pandas code to work, but also to think about where the data comes from what and what you are trying to accomplish!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Though California has passed a number of laws lessening penalties for marijuana possession over the years, arguably the biggest changes were in  2010, when the state changed the penalty for possessing a small amount of marijuana from a criminal crime to a \"civil\" penality (meaning those found guilty only had to pay a fine, not go to jail), though possessing, selling, or producing larger quantities remained illegal. Then in 2016, the state fully legalized marijuana for recreational use, not only making possession of small amounts legal, but also creating a regulatory system for producing marijuana for sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of drug legalization have long argued that the war on drugs contributes to violent crime by creating an opportunity for drug dealers and organized crime to sell and distribute drugs, a business which tends to generate violence when gangs battle over territory. According to this theory, with drug legalization, we should see violent crime decrease after legalization in places where drug arrests had previously been common. In this exercise, we will explore this argument and explore the relationship between drug legalization and violent crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To be clear,** drug legalization is a complex issue and far more study than what we will do here is required to understand its complexities! This exercise is meant to help you think through how to address data science questions programmatically."

    "If we plotted our rate data for 2009 (violent crime arrest rate vs felony drug arrest rate) it would show that drug arrests and violent crime arrests tend to be positively correlated, but that does not tell us much about whether they are *causally* related. It *could* be the case that people dealing drugs *causes* more violent crime, but it could also be that certain communities, for some other reason, tend to have *both* more drug sales *and* more violent crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to test for this, we went to see if the same communities that had violent crime in 2009 *also* have violent crime in 2019 (after marijuana legalization). If these communities have just as much crime in 2018, that would suggest that violent crime is being driven by a third factor, and not drug sales of marijuana. "
