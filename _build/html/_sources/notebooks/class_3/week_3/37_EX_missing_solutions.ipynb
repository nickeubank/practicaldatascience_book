If you recall from our last exercise, it seemed to be the case that most of the people who had incomes of 9999999 were children. Let's make sure that's true by looking at the distribution of the variable `age` for people for whom `inctot` is missing (i.e. subset the data to people with `inctot` missing, then look at the values of `age` with `value_counts()`).\n",

So you can't just use `min()` or `max()`. We'll discuss converting string variables into numbers in a future class."
