# Class 5: Towards the practice of data science
- Theme: Program like a software engineer; think like a data scientist
- Learning objectives:
  - Make reproducible, customizable plots that use programming to reveal data insights
  - Use programming skills to create software for common data science applications
  - Conduct a full-scale data science analysis that makes use of the programming tools developed through the course and specialization

## WEEK 1: Visualizing Data with Code: Plotting with Matplotlib (Kyle)
- Why do we plot? Visual exploration, communication, and summarization
- Introduction to plotting with code: Matplotlib basics
- Procedural versus object oriented approaches to plotting
- Basic Plotting: coding a plot in 4 lines of code or less
  - Common plot forms: scatter, line, bar, and heatmaps
- Using code to inspect your data: Datasaurus / Anscombes Quartet
- Histograms for data summarization
- Making highly customized and fully reproducible plots with code
- Effective plotting practices
- Other plotting tools in Python

## WEEK 2: Using Code to Make Predictions from Data: Classification and Regression (Kyle)
- Introduction to prediction (supervised learning): classification and regression
- Preparing your data: training and test data
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification
- Coding a KNN classifier
- Applying your KNN classifier to real world data
- How to convert your KNN classifier into a regression tool
- Common programming tools for prediction

## WEEK 3: Using Code to Draw Inferences from Data: Regression (Nick)
- From prediction to inference: understanding relationships between inputs and outputs
- Introducing linear regression
  - Link out to Mina's course on linear regression
- Understanding standard errors
- Interpreting regression results
- Real-world example of applying regression for inference
- The importance of modeling assumptions
- Common programming tools for inference

## WEEK 4: Bringing it All Together: Final Coding Project (Kyle and Nick)
- Intro to the GapMinder project
- Motivation: background on the problem (and how to formulate data science question)
- Gathering and merging the data
- Drafting a plot of the data
- Refining a plot of the data
- Training a regression model on the data
- Determining the relationships between predictors
- Interpreting and sharing your findings
