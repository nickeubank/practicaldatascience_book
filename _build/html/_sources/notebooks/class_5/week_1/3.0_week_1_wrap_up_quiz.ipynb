    "Over the course of this module, you explored best practices in plotting and learned how to generate plots with Python through `matplotlib`. These skills are invaluable for data science as clearly communicating your findings is a skill that sets great data scientists apart. And you most certainly will need to communicate your findings and do so regularly! In this wrap up quiz, we'll review some of the key concepts from this module.\n",
