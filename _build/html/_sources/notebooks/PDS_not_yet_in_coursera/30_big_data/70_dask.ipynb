    "# Distributed Computing with dask\n",
    "\n",
    "In this portion of the course, we'll explore distributed computing with a Python library called `dask`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a library designed to help facilitate (a) the manipulation of very large datasets, and (b) the distribution of computation across lots of cores or physical computers. It is very similar to Apache Spark in the functionality it provides, but it is tightly integrated into `numpy` and `pandas`, making it *much* easier to learn than spark for users of those libraries (there's no java dependencies, for example, and the syntax is what you already know!).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can dask do for me?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense of why dask is so nice, let's begin with a demonstration. Suppose I have a pretty big dataset (say, [an 100GB CSV of all drug shipments in the United States from 2006 to 2014](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oiv3k3sfwiviup5/all_prescriptions.csv?dl=0)). This data is too large for me to load into ram on my laptop directly, so if I were to work with it on my own, I'd do so by [chunking the data by hand](20_big_data_strategies.ipynb). But using dask, I can do the following:"

    "\n",
    "1. First, when I ran Client(), dask started up a set of 5 new python processes on my computer (called \"workers\") it could call on for help, each of which had access to two threads (so dask has access to 10 threads total). These processes fully independent agents that could be running on different machines in a true cluster (though in this case, they're all on my laptop).\n",
    "2. dask collected all the instructions I gave it for reading in the file, generating a new column, deleting extra columns, and grouping. **But it didn't actually execute any code**. That's why when I typed `collapsed`, what I got back was a dataframe with structure but no data—dask had figured out roughly what the result of my commands would look like, but hadn't actually computed the result.\n",
    "3. Then, when I ran `collapsed.compute()`, dask came up with a set of assignments it could give to its workers to get me what I wanted and it started to actually compute the table I requested. In particular:\n",
    "    - each thread loaded a chunk of the data, did the observation-level manipulations I wanted, and dropped extra columns.\n",
    "    - then to execute the groupby, it then collapses the data in each chunk, passes those collapsed chunks to a common worker who then re-collapses them further, then gathers them again under (potentially) another worker and collapses further until all the data had been collapsed.\n",
    "    - Finally, after all the data had been collapsed, the data was passed back to me (the client session) as the variable `final`.\n",

    "The answer is that these distributed computing tools are often very fragile and opaque, and it's easy to get in trouble using them, and hard to figure out why if you don't understand the underlying principles that govern their operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This example was carefully chosen. I used only manipulations that dask is really good at, and I have the experience to implement them in a way that works. But do what I did above in slightly different ways, and chaos would ensue. Ok, not chaos. But your computer would probably crash. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge in using a tool like dask or spark (they operate on the same principles -- more on that below) is that to prevent crashes, you have to understand how and why dask is chunking your data. And the best way to do that is to get experience chunking by hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one of the key features of distributed computing is that they don't run code as soon as you type it. Instead, they just keep track of what you want and wait until you run `.compute()` to actually execute your code. Why? Because if dask had run each command as I entered it and passed the result back to me, it would have crashed my computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the whole reason we're using dask is precisely because we knew that loading the whole dataset at once would take up more memory than I have available. It's only because we only loaded a few chunks of the data at a time, thinned out those chunks by dropping variables, and then collapsed by county-state-year that we ended up with a dataset that was small enough that it would fit in memory.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Lazy Evaluation** (also sometimes called \"delayed execution\"): The practice of not executing code as soon as you type it, but rather accumulating a set of requests, then executing them when instructed. This allows distributing computing systems to optimize how they move around data and get things done, and ensures that you don't end up with the system trying to shove a massive dataset into ram that's too small. \n",
    "- **Client**: The central process (here, Python process) where code is being entered.\n",
    "- **Workers**: Other processes that are assigned work, and which eventually pass results back to the client. \n",
    "- **Scheduler**: The part of the system that manages the assignment of tasks to different workers.\n",
    "- **map-reduce**: The name for the process of distributing sub-problems to workers (`map`), then processing them in a way that allows the results to be recombined (`reduce`). `map`s and `reduce`s are kind of the building blocks of distributed systems, though when working with dask you won't usually have to manage the assignment or recombination of tasks yourself (they're happening behind the scenes).

    "Dask is something of a late-comer to the distributed computing game. Before its rise, the most popular platforms were Hadoop and Spark (spark is basically \"Hadoop v2.0\"). So... how does dask compare to these? Or more specifically, how does dask compare to Spark (since no one uses Hadoop anymore) and the various Python libraries for using Spark (e.g. PySpark and koalas)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of functionality, dask and Spark basically do the same things. Both are tools for distributed computing across many computers, and conceptually they work in basically the same ways:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Both offer both low-level tools (things like `map`/`filter` in pyspark, and `delayed` in dask) as well as higher-level data structures (`spark` has `spark dataframes`, dask has `dask arrays`; `spark` has RDDs, dask has `dask arrays`).\n",
    "- Both are fault tolerant (if one machine in your cluster dies, the system knows what the machine that died was doing and can assign it to another cluster).\n",
    "- Both make use of delayed execution / lazy evaluation to allow the system to develop efficient plans for completing a computation efficiently.\n",
    "- Both can be run on your own computer, or on a cluster of lots of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The huge difference, though, is that dask lets you write code with the pandas syntax you already know.** Seriously. There are lots of little \"under the hood\" things, but from the perspective of an applied Data Scientist, that's the big one: it's just a version of pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, as we'll see in [later lessons](cloud_dask.ipynb), dask is also insanely easy to setup on a distributed cluster, making it not only easier to use than Spark for a pandas user, but generally also much easier to get up and running (at least in my experience).\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark, by contrast, is a stand-alone system. It's built to run on Java virtual machines, and Spark itself is written in a language called Scala. It is not a tool for pandas users per se, and so it has its own syntax for manipulating datasets that is distinct from that of `numpy` and `pandas`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A Note on Koalas:** in the last couple years, there have been inroads in implementing the pandas API on top of spark—check out [koalas](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/10min.html) project if you're at a place that uses spark! But, as usual, my preference is to hew close to tried and trusted tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for which is more popular, as is so often the case with software, it depends on where you're working. In this class, I've decided to teach dask because you don't have to learn a new syntax, so you can instead just focus on learning how distributed computing works. But if you get a job someday that requires you to work with Spark, don't panic -- you'll find that all the concepts you've learned for using dask also apply to Spark—you'll just have to learn some new syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as for performance, it probably depends on the workload, but I've yet to see anything that suggests dask compute times are slower than Spark compute times. Case studies are always tricky since performance depends on the exact work being done, but here's one [case study comparison of performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13030) that puts dask just a little ahead. And I've heard reports of dask beating Spark by 40x in another project. So personally, I think dask is a no-brainer if you aren't working at a company that it is already using spark: it will take **much** less of your time setup and use, and it should at least run about even with Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only exceptions are some specific use cases, like network analysis, where Spark has some libraries that dask does not. For more on these types of issues, check out this [conceptual comparison to Spark](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html)."

    "If you want to use dask on a single computer but don't need to deal with concepts like lazy evaluation and delayed execution, there's a library called [modin](https://modin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) that is meant to be a drop-in replacement for pandas (you literally just write `import modin as pd` instead of `import pandas as pd`) that will parallelize as much code as possible using dask behind the scenes. You can't easily use it to run code across lots of computers, but if you're on a single computer and you don't have to be super careful, it'll give you a little speedup."
