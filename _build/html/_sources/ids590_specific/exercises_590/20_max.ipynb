    "# Writing Your First Function (max)\n",

    "In this exercise, you will write your first simple function in Python and submit it on gradescope. The goal of this exercises is mostly to get you familiar with the process of writing, testing, submitting, and revising code in this class. \n",

    "\n",
    "To begin, in VS Code create a new file and save it as `max.py`. Each assignment will have a different name, and it's important that you give the file for each assignment the correct name to help the autograder identify your submission. \n",

    "In `max`, the algorithm is written as comments, but there is no code. You should translate this algorithm to code.\n",

    "There is also a comment asking you to write one more print statement with a call to `max`. In that comment, it asks you to take the max of two numbers and print them out. Add a line of code to do this.\n",

    "When you have done this, first run your code with the \"Run code\" button in the upper right corner of VS Code.  If you have any syntax errors, you will get information about where they are, and should fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print` statement that are called when `main` runs are a set of example tests designed to give you quick feedback on whether your code is doing what it should do. The output expected from the four print statements (that is, the three already present plus the one you have been asked to add) is:\n",
