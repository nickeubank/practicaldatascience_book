    "For this assignment, you will write a program that counts how many times each word appears in a text file and prints out the results. For example, in one of the files we will provide you — `caesar.txt`, which is part of the text of Julius Caesar — you will find that the word \"caesar\" appears 34 times (ignoring case).\n",

    "[Download and unzip this zip file](https://github.com/nickeubank/practicaldatascience_book/raw/refs/heads/main/Example_Data/wordcount_texts.zip) which contains four `.txt` text files with content from the plays Julius Caesar, Hamlet, Henry VIII, and Macbeth. Place these in the directory in which you plan to work. (You don't need to upload these files to the autograder — it will have its own copies.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a file called `countwords.py` in that same directory. \n",
    "- Copy-paste into it the scaffolding code down below and save. \n",
    "- Quit and re-open VS Code.\n",
    "- Under `File` in VS Code, select `\"Open Folder...\"` and open the directory where you placed `countwords.py` and `caesar.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the function `count_words(counts, line)` which takes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `counts`: a dictionary that maps words to how many times they appear, and \n",
    "- `line`: a string, which you should split into words and, for each word you see, update counts to reflect that occurrence of the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function should return the updated \"counts\" dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python strings come with a number of standard methods for string manipulation [you can read about here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods). \n",
    "    - Of particular interest for this exercise is probably the `.split()` method (e.g., `my_string.split()`). `.split()` splits string into a list of sub-strings where it makes a split anywhere it sees whitespace (like a space or newline). So in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_string = \"hello world!\"\n",
    "    my_string.split()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    will return `[\"hello\", \"world!\"]`.\n",
    "- We have provided a simple \"print_results\" which just prints `counts`: you can use it to test your `count_words` function before you proceed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the results of `count_words`, you will see that sometimes we end up with words like `\"now,\"` (with a comma) which really just should be `\"now\"`. Likewise, `\"The\"` and `\"the\"` are counted as two separate words. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can improve on your `count_words` by using the following two string methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `string.strip(\"-?.!,[]—:;'\\\"\")`: will return a string with any leading or trailing occurrences of any of the characters `-?.!,[]—:;\"'` removed.\n",
    "- `string.lower()` will return string with all characters converted to lower case letters. (there is also a `.upper()` to go the other way if you ever need).\n"

    "## Step 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "`print_results` currently just prints the dictionary using its built in conversion to a string. That is fine for testing, but not a great output format. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, you should replace the code in `print_results` so that it prints out each word and its corresponding count, 1 per line, with a space, a colon, and a space between the word and count. e.g.: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "and : 59\n",
    "a : 27\n",
    "the : 72\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with this, it may be useful to know about the three main ways to dump data out of a dictionary: `.items()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.items()` returns a collection of tuples, where each tuple has a key (in this case, the word), and the associated value (in this case, the count).\n",
    "- `.keys()` returns a collection of all the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "- `.values()` returns a collection of all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To convert one of the collections you get back from `.items()`, `.keys()`, or `.values()` into a list, just use the `list()` function. e.g.: `keys_as_list = list(my_dict.keys())`."
