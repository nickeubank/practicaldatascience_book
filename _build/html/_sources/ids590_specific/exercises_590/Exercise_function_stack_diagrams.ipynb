This `if` statement will be true anytime a `.py` file is directly executed (e.g., by clicking the triangle \"play\" button in VS Code). So it will behave exactly the way `main()` has operated in all the exercises you've done so far.\n",

    "The if statement is commonly used in Python because it will *not* be true if someone imports this file into another program. When a file is imported into another program, Python runs most of the code in the imported file so the functions in the file will be available in the importing program. But since we sometimes have code we don't want run in that situation, we put it inside an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` statement.\n",

    "> What exactly is `__name__` and why does it matter if it is equal to `\"__main__\"`? You don't need to worry about understanding it, but if you're curious: when a Python file is run, Python automatically creates a variable called `__name__`. If the file has been called directly, the value of `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`. But if a file is imported (like when a file is run in the process of importing a module), `__name__` takes on the value of module name. "
