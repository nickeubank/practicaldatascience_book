    "Up to this point, we've been representing arrays in Python as shown in the figure below under \"a\" - suggesting that the variables ARE the objects they point to, shown here in terms of the relationship between `my_list` and the contents of the corresponding array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables and the objects they point to live in two different places on your computer. As a result, in Python, it’s best to think of variables as pointing to the objects they’re associated with, rather than being those objects. Personally, I’ve always liked the analogy of your computer being a big warehouse, where variables are just the entries in the inventory book used by the warehouse manager: the variable tells you how to find the thing you want, but it is not the thing itself. This is true of lists, numpy arrays, integers, or strings. The name we give it is the variable, and it is a pointer to the place in memory that contains the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you create a new array, Python puts that list somewhere in memory, kind of like how you might put something big on a shelf in a warehouse. The variable associated with that list (say, `my_array`) actually just stores the location of the shelf where that list was placed (which we call a reference or a pointer). This is represented in the figure below in \"b\".\n"

When we assign one variable the value of another variable, we are often simply assigning the *pointer* (or reference) of an object to the variable, as shown in the figure below, where we assign the pointer to the array object from `my_array` to `my_view` creating a view instead of a copy."
