    "# Viewing the World in New Ways Using Remote Sensing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed in our last section that natural color imagery is based on three color bands: red, green, and blue, which each correspond to the measurements of a sensor (i.e. a camera) collecting information on the wavelengths of light that correspond to the colors red (625-750 nm), green (500-565nm), and blue (450-485nm). These are the colors our built-in sensors (eyeballs) can detect. However, there are many other wavelengths to explore. Frequently, when we're working with remote sensing data from satellites, we do not solely care about RGB data, but also infrared data that measures light around 840nm in wavelength. Near-infrared (NIR) data can be exceptionally informative for learning about the presence and health of vegetation which can be useful for agriculture as well as understanding the degree of urban development in a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll explore how we can work with matrices to gain more information about vegetation in a region using a collection of satellite imagery from Kansas, USA from the Sentinel-2 instrument of the European Space Administration (ESA). You can explore publicly available ESA data at https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at each band individually, then the RGB bands together for a standard natural color image. From there we'll take a look at a false color infrared image which will provide information on the relative health of the vegetation. Lastly, we'll explore the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) which is used to quantify the amount of vegetation present in a region.\n"

    "We'll get started by loading are data as a set of three separate matrices representing the red, blue, green, and NIR bands of our data. Here's the code to get you started. This code loads four numpy arrays, one for red, green, blue, and NIR: `band2_blue`, `band3_green`, `band4_red`, and `band8_nir`."

However, to make a color image, you'll need to make a 3-D array out of the channels in the correct order. We've explored some approaches to combining arrays of data together, but in this case, we want to add the data along a *new* dimension to make this a 3-D array from 2-D data. \n",
