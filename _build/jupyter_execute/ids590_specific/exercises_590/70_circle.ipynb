    "When it works well, the idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) is for the code you write to be *composable* — that is, like Legos, you should be able to click together different things you've built to make something that is more than the sum of its parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept, in this class you will define a `Circle` class in a manner that builds on the Point class you wrote in your [previous assignment](./60_points.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "If creating Point or Circle objects feels esoteric or silly, don't be fooled — being able to do geometric operations is key to a wide range of applications. Perhaps the most well known is geospatial analysis (often referred to as GIS, which is short for Geospatial Information Systems) — the science of understanding how things relate to one another spatially in the real world. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Point` and `Circle` objects are two of the primitives GIS analysts use on a daily basis. Points can represent anything from an election polling place to the location of a source of airborne pollution or a ship at sea. Circles (and tools for measuring overlaps between circles or circles and points) are used to identify people or animals within a given radius of a point, or an area that may be exposed to a certain intensity of radiation generated from a point. Indeed, in these exercises we're basically recreating some of the primitives used in one of the most important software libraries in the Python GIS ecosystem ([shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html))."

    "The first thing you will put at the top of your code for this assignment — which should be in a file called `circle.py` — will be the line:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Provided your `point.py` file is in the same directory as your `circle.py` file*, this line will import your Point class and make it accessible from within this `circle.py` file. You can refer to it as just `Point` (like `p = Point()`). Note that if we had just said `import point` instead of `from point import Point`, you would need to write `p = point.Point()` to create a point object. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note we have now come... *full circle* (sorry, couldn't resist) with that `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` if statement. As mentioned before, code that is in that `if` block is only ever executed when a file is executed directly. But at the time, what it meant to *not* execute a file directly may have been unclear. Now you know! When we run `from point import Point`, Python is running all the code in `point.py` that defines the class `Point` and its functionality so it becomes accessible inside of this `circle.py` program. But it won't run the tests at the bottom of `point.py` because that `if` statement does not evaluate to `True`.\n",

    "For the Circle class, you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Docstring summarizing the class.\n",
    "- An `__init__` method: takes a Point c and a floating point number r and assigns the center and radius respectively. \n",
    "    - The default values should be a point at (0, 0) and radius 1. \n",
    "    - You should assert that the radius is greater than or equal to 0. Remember that Point is a mutable type, so you do not want to actually make the default value Point(0,0) as that will cause problems (as you learned in \"Default Arguments Revisited\").  Instead, you use the \"default value is None, check for None, make the value you want\" idiom that you learned in that reading.\n",
    "- A `__str__` method: returns a string representation of the circle. For example, a circle at (0, 0) with radius 1 would be: `\"((0, 0), 1)\"`\n",
    "- A `__repr__` method: returns a more detailed string representation of the circle. For example, a circle at (0,0) with radius 1 would be: `\"Circle((0, 0), 1)\"`\n",
    "- A `move` method: takes `dx` and `dy` and moves the center of the circle accordingly. **Remember, you already wrote move for Point!**\n",
    "- An `intersection_area` method: takes a parameter `other_circle` and calculates the intersection of `self`, and `other_circle`. \n",

    "Remember that a question like \"what is the formula for the intersection area of two circles?\" indicates a lack of domain knowledge (not a lack of programming skill).  In such situations, you should consult an authoritative source in that domain.  For this problem, the following source derives the equation you need: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-CircleIntersection.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you need equation (14) on that page.  You can compute $cos^{-1}(x)$ with `math.acos(x)` in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the formula described above is for the case where the circles partially overlap.  You will need to determine if the circles do not overlap at all, partially overlap, or overlap completely.  If they do not overlap at all, the intersection area is 0.  If they partially overlap, use the formula above. If they overlap completely, the intersection area is the area of the smaller circle. \n",
