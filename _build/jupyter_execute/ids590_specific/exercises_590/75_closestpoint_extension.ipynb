    "In Course 1, we worked through the first 4 steps for the \"closest point\" problem---given a set `S` and a point `P`, find the member of `S` which is closest to `P`. Now you are ready to turn this into code, though as we will describe below, we are going to change the problem slightly (so you will want to work back through Steps 1--4).\n",

    "Note that this is slightly different then what we did in the Course 1 video for Steps 1--4, where we returned one single point.  \n",
    "\n",

    "In order to implement this algorithm correctly, it will be necessary for you to use a special function you have not encountered before for comparing two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will discuss later in the semester, when computers work with integers (`-1`, `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.), it stores those as exact values. `1`, in a computer, is always equal to `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the same cannot be said for non-integer numbers (e.g., `2.5`, `1.233`, etc.). Numbers that are not integers are stored in as a data type called a floating point number, or `float` for short. These numbers are actually represented in memory as very clever approximations of the numbers we see using a format that allows them to store both tiny numbers `0.0000000024` and gigantic numbers `1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000` using the same amount of space of memory (64 bits, or 64 1s and 0s.).\n",
    "\n",
    "But because these numbers are only approximations, occassionally weird things happen. For example, if you ask a computer whether `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3`, the computer will say that those are different:"
