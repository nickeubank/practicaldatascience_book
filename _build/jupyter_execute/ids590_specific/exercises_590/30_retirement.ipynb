    "Given that goal, the function really has to perform two tasks (which are similar---look for a chance to abstract something out into a function!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Job 1: Update Balance While Working\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it should compute your retirement account balance each month while you are working. To do this, you need to calculate the account balance increase from returns (`balance * rate of return`), and add that to the current balance. You then need to add the monthly contribution to the balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have \\$1,000 in the account, earn a 0.5% rate of return per month, and contribute $100 per month, you would compute `1000 * 0.005 = $5` in interest earned. You would then add this plus the monthly contribution to the balance to end up with \\$1105 in the account at the end of the month. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each month (before the balance changes), you should print out the current balance with the following format helpers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f\"Age {age_in_years:3d} month {age_in_months:2d} you have ${balance:,.2f}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two format conversions are the savers age in years and months. The third format conversion is the account balance. This calculation goes on for the number of months specified in the \"working\" tuple. For a reminder on how f-strings work, [check here](../../notebooks/other/fstrings.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Job 2: Update Balance While Retired\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you should perform a very similar calculation for each month of retirement. The difference here is that you will use the information in the \"retired\" tuple instead of the information in the \"working\"\n",
    "tuple. As with working, you should print out the same information as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** since you are performing a very similar computation, think about how you can abstract that part out into a function, and reuse it, rather than rewriting it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided you with a main function that calls your function to do the following calculations:\n",
