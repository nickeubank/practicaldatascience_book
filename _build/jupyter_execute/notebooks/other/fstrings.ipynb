    "We frequently need to combine numbers and text: legends and titles on plots, formatting the output from a model that summarizes the findings in a human-readable manner, etc. If we have a variable, let's say, `number_of_apples` and `number_of_pears` and we want to print out a sentence that says how many apples and pears we have, we need a way to combine a string and a number to say something like \"I have 42 apples and 24 pears\". There are a few approaches to doing this programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first thought may be to use the `+` operator, knowing that it can concatenate strings together and convert any numbers to strings along the way. For example, for our apples and pears example, we may approach that as follows:"

This brings us to another feature of these strings: our ability to control the formatting of the output including the precision of the number of digits. To do this, we can add add a colon `:` after our variable with a number formatting code. For example, let's say we only wanted 2 digits after the decimal. We could tell the f-string to do so with the `.3f` code which says to use 3 points after the decimal and represent it as a floating point number. Let's see that in action:"
