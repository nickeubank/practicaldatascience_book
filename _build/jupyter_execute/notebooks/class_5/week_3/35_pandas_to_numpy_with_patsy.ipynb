    "In our last reading, we learned about the `ols` function in `statsmodels.formula.api`, and the ease with which it allows data scientists to not only fit a linear regression on data stored in Pandas. We saw how easy it was to work with the regression results, to change features like how standard errors were calculated, to evaluate model performance, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing we deliberately did not go into in the last reading was the details of the model specification. The formula we used — `\"mortality_rate_under5_per_1000 ~ np.log(gdp_per_capita_ppp) + CPIA_public_sector_rating + region\"` — isn't too hard to interpret, and if you're coming from the R programming language it likely looked very familiar. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, we'll pull back the curtain a little on how statsmodels used data from a pandas DataFrame to fit a linear regression, even though some of the contents of that DataFrame were string variables (like `region`). In doing so, we'll not only learn the details of how to specify models using these formula strings, but also the nuts and bolts of model fitting — an understanding that will be critical for successfully navigating the Python Data Science ecosystem beyond statsmodels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Hidden Step Between Pandas and Your Results \n",
    "\n",
    "At the level of the underlying math, a linear regression is fit using matrix calculations. Indeed, if you imagine putting your outcome variable in a vector called $y$ and your explanatory variables in a matrix $X$ where each column is one of your explanatory variables and each row is an observation. To get our vector of coefficients $\\beta$, your computer uses the following matrix formula (don't worry if you don't know what all the terms there mean — I just want to try and make this concrete by showing the formula):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta = (X^TX)^{-1} X^Ty$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we get $\\beta$ by doing some matrix multiplication and calculating matrix inverses on our data. Indeed, matrix math (also known as matrix algebra) underlies a huge proportion of statistics and machine learning tools, which is one of the reasons that a linear algebra course (the part of math focused on the study of matrix math) is often recommended for data science students. (Don't worry — you don't need to know linear algebra to start as a data scientist, and you don't need to understand that formula above; I'm just telling you this to motivate what comes next).\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can't always do matrix math on a pandas DataFrame. pandas DataFrames are great because of their flexibility, but you can't multiply to pandas DataFrames that contain some integer columns, some floating point columns, and some string columns. Moreover, you also can't do matrix calculations with missing values — the inverse of a matrix with missing values is not a defined concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how was `smf.ols()` able to fit that regression? [patsy](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html). patsy is a package that takes as input a pandas DataFrame and a formula (like the `\"mortality_rate_under5_per_1000 ~ np.log(gdp_per_capita_ppp) + CPIA_public_sector_rating + region\"` formula we used above), and returns a numpy array of floating point numbers without missing data (and with labels!) on which matrix algebra can be performed. All `smf.ols()` is doing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- calling patsy, \n",
    "- giving patsy your DataFrame and formula, \n",
    "- taking the numpy arrays it returns, and \n",
    "- passing those arrays to its more traditional OLS function, `OLS()` from `statsmodels.api`. \n",
    "\n",
    "That function then does the actual matrix algebra described above and gives you back a result!"
