    "# Practical Example: comparing weather by counting like-values\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in data science, we want to know how our data are distributed. If we were summarizing the weather in a region we may want to know how many days a year it rains, snows, is cloudy or sunny.  To answer these questions, we typically need to count like-values. To explore an example of this, let's flex our `numpy` array summarization muscles now. Let's say we have a matrix containing weather data over a 2-week period for 5 cities. Each entry in the matrix is an integer between 0 and 4 where these represent the following weather conditions:\n",

First, (1) determine how many of each integer (kind of weather) there are in an array (a row, which represents a city), then (2) repeat this for each city (each row). We'll see later how to do this in just a few lines of code using `pandas`. Let's create a function for part (1).\n",
