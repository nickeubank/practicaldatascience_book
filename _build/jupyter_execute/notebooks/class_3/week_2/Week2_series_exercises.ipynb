    "> This exercise has been written out in something called a Jupyter Notebook. We'll discuss Jupyter Notebooks in more detail later in this specialization—they are very a powerful tool for data science communication!—but for the time being, the notebook is just a convenient way for us to write out the exercise. You don't need to *do* anything with the notebook except read its contents—just use write your Python code in a regular `.py` file.\n",

    "> When asked to round your answers to a certain number of decimals, do *not* round any results until you've finished your computations and have your final answer! For example, if you were to calculate the average hourly wage for workers, and you did so by first calculating the average weekly salary of workers and the average hours worked per week, then divided the first number by the second, you should NOT round the average weekly salary of workers or the average hours worked per week. Rounding intermediate results can lead to compounding errors that cause problems for the autograder.\n",

    "One measure of inequality frequently used by economists, lawyers, social scientists, and policymakers is the *[Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)*. The Gini coefficient takes as input the allocation of some resource — income, wealth, market share, etc. — for all entities in a population and returns a single number between 0 and 1 that summarizes the inequality of the distribution of said resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini coefficient takes on a value of 1 when the resource distribution is maximally *unequal* across the entities (e.g., one entity has all of the resource and no one else has any), and a value of 0 when the resource is evenly distributed across all entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will calculate the Gini coefficient for income inequality across the countries of the world to get a sense of income inequality *across* countries. \n"
