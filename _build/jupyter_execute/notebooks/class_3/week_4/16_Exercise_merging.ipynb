    "In recent years, many US states have decided to legalize the use of marijuana. \n",
    "\n",

    "In this exercise, we're going to test a few of those theories using drug arrest data from the state of California.\n",

    "Though California has passed a number of laws lessening penalties for marijuana possession over the years, arguably the biggest changes were in  2010, when the state changed the penalty for possessing a small amount of marijuana from a criminal crime to a \"civil\" penality (meaning those found guilty only had to pay a fine, not go to jail), though possessing, selling, or producing larger quantities remained illegal. Then in 2016, the state fully legalized marijuana for recreational use, not only making possession of small amounts legal, but also creating a regulatory system for producing marijuana for sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of drug legalization have long argued that the war on drugs contributes to violent crime by creating an opportunity for drug dealers and organized crime to sell and distribute drugs, a business which tends to generate violence when gangs battle over territory. According to this theory, with drug legalization, we should see violent crime decrease after legalization in places where drug arrests had previously been common. In this exercise, we will explore this argument and explore the relationship between drug legalization and violent crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To be clear,** drug legalization is a complex issue and far more study than what we will do here is required to understand its complexities! This exercise is meant to help you think through how to address data science questions programmatically."
