    "In recent years, many US states have decided to legalize the use of marijuana. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these ideas were first proposed, there were many theories about the relationship between crime and the \"War on Drugs\" (the term given to US efforts to arrest drug users and dealers over the past several decades). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to test a few of those theories using drug arrest data from the state of California. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though California has passed a number of laws lessening penalities for marijuana possession over the years, arguably the biggest changes were in  2010, when the state changed the penalty for possessing a small amount of marijuana from a criminal crime to a \"civil\" penality (meaning those found guilty only had to pay a fine, not go to jail), though possessing, selling, or producing larger quantities remained illegal. Then in 2016, the state fully legalized marijuana for recreational use, not only making possession of small amounts legal, but also creating a regulatory system for producing marijuana for sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of drug legalization have long argued that the war on drugs contributes to violent crime by creating an opportunity for drug dealers and organized crime to sell and distribute drugs, a business which tends to generate violence when gangs battle over territory. According to this theory, with drug legalization, we should see violent crime decrease after legalization in places where drug arrests had previously been common. In this exercise, we will explore this argument and explore the relationship between drug legalization and violent crime.\n",

    "## Checking Your Merges\n",
    "\n",
    "**(6)** When you merge data, you have to make some assumptions about the nature of the data you're working with. For example, you have to assume it's OK to connect variables that share the same value of your merging variables. Similarly, you have to make assumptions about whether your merge a one-to-one merge (meaning there is only one observation of the variable you're merging on in both datasets), a one-to-many merge (meaning there is only one observation of the variable you're merging on in the first dataset, but multiple observations in the second). So before running a merge, answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What variable do you think will be consistent across these two datasets you can use for merging?\n",
    "2. Do you think there will be exactly 1 observation for each value in your *arrest* data?\n",
    "3. Do you think there will be exactly 1 observation for each value in your *population* data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Being correct in your assumptions about these things is *very* important. If you think there's only one observation per value of your merging variable in each dataset, but there are in fact 2, you'll end up with two observations for each value after the merge. If that were two happen, the structure of your data would be damaged and it would indicate that you didn't understand something about your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the importance of this, `pandas` provides a utility for *testing* these assumptions when you do a merge: the `validate` keyword! Validate will accept `\"1:1\"`, `\"1:m\"`, `\"m:1\"`, and `\"m:m\"` where the 'm' stands for \"many\". It will then check to make sure your merge matches the type of merge you think it is. I *highly* recommend always using this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the merge you conducted above, but this time use the `validate` keyword to make sure your assumptions about the data were correct. "

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**(7)** Checking whether you are doing a one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many merge is only the first type of diagnostic test you should run on *every* merge you conduct. The second test is to see if you data merged successfully!\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with this, the `merge` function in pandas offers a keyword option called `indicator`. If you set `indicator` to `True`, then pandas will add a column to the result of your merge called `_merge`. This variable will tell you, for each observation in your merged data, whether:  (a) that observation came from a successful merge of both datasets, (b) if that observation was in the left dataset (the first one you passed) but not the right dataset, or (c) if that observation was in the right dataset but not the left). This allows you to quickly identify failed merges!\n",
