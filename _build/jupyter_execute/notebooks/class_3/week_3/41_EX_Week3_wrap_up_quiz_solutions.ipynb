We'll discuss Jupyter Notebooks in more detail later in this specialization—they are very a powerful tool for data science communication!—but for the time being, the notebook is just a convenient way for us to write out the exercise.

    "> When asked to round your answers to a certain number of decimals, do *not* round any results until you've finished your computations and have your final answer! For example, if you were to calculate the average hourly wage for workers, and you did so by first calculating the average weekly salary of workers and the average hours worked per week, then divided the first number by the second, you should NOT round the average weekly salary of workers or the average hours worked per week. Rounding intermediate results can lead to compounding errors that cause problems for the autograder.\n",

We're only working with more recent data, so anyone with a value of `90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)` can safely be assumed to be 90 years old."
