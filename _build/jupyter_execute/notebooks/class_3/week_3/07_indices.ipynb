    "# Pandas Indices (Index Labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the defining features of pandas data structures is that all rows and columns come with *labels*. Index labels (the labels assigned to rows of the data) are always present in both Series and DataFrames and can be accessed through the `.index` attribute (e.g., `my_dataframe.index`), and column labels are always present in DataFrames and can be accessed through the `.columns` attribute (e.g., `my_dataframe.columns`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of column names, I think most people would agree, is an unequivocal strength of pandas ‚Äî it makes it easy to remember the *substantive* meaning of the different variables in your data, and to write code that very explicitly states what variables are being manipulated (as opposed to working with column numbers, as one does with numpy). \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of all pandas rows having index labels, however, is less clear. Actually, strike that. We're comfortable saying that **the fact all pandas rows come with index labels is one of the most confusing and least useful features of pandas.** And so in this reading, while we will review the basics of how these index labels work, we our primary focus will actually be to help you learn how to prevent them from getting in the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, admittedly, a very opinionated take on index labels, but I think that the fact that pandas is the *only* tabular data library we know of that has this feature ‚Äî including many libraries developed since pandas that could have adopted this approach if they'd wanted ‚Äî is illustrative of the fact that most people don't see this as a particularly valuable addition to tabular data structures like Series and DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vocabulary, A Review\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in our readings on Series and DataFrames, **in this course** we will try to always make use of two distinct terms for the different ways to identify rows in a pandas data structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Index labels*: these are labels for rows that can be accessed through the `.index` attribute (e.g., `my_series.index`). To access a row using index labels, one uses the `.loc[]` operator. Note that what *we* call index labels are usually just referred to as the \"index\" in most documentation about pandas.\n",
    "- *Row numbers*: these are the numbers one would naturally assign to the rows of a Series or DataFrame based on the relative order in which they appear, starting with row 0 (since this is Python), then moving to row 1, row 2, etc. These row numbers operate the same way row numbers operate in numpy (or in other languages, like R, Julia, Java, etc.), and you can access rows by row number using `.iloc[]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these seem like obviously distinct concepts in the abstract, things quickly become confusing because the *default* index labels pandas assigns to rows is... their row numbers. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è As a result, when you load a new dataset, if you don't set the index explicitly, each row's index labels and row numbers will be the same:"

Use `.sort_values(\"name_of_column\")`. Want to sort by the index labels? `.sort_index()`. Want to get rows where the column `polityIV == 16`? `small_world[small_world.polityIV == 16]`.

    "## So... If They're Such A Pain, Why Do Index Labels Exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think index labels came into existence out of a well-meaning desire to make life easier for users by offering two special features for free. The first is index alignment. By *implicitly* doing a merge/join of pandas Series, I think the idea was that it would make life easier by not requiring users to do their merges explicitly. But... sometimes it's better to have simple, predictable behaviors (matching up row 1 to row 1, etc.), and to let people do merges explicitly when they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is that pulling out rows using `.loc[]` and an index label (e.g., `small_world.loc[16]`) is faster than subsetting from a regular column (e.g., `small_world.loc[small_world[\"polityIV\"] == 16]`). That's because index labels are basically like a Python dictionary ‚Äî getting values using an index label is an O(1) operation (if you recall that discussion from previous weeks), while subsetting based on regular column values is O(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem, however, is that grabbing an arbitrary row really fast isn't a common data science use case, while index labels are present in all pandas data structures. Having a way to get an arbitrary row quickly is a nice feature, and one other libraries have implemented as an *optional* feature. But baking it into all data structures just complicates everything to accommodate something most people never do with pandas."
