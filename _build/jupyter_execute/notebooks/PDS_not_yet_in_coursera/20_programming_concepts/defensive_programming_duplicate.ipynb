    "We've already covered tricks to maximize the probability we catch our mistakes, but how do we minimize the likelihood they will occur? If there is anything I learned working as the Replication Assistant at the *Quarterly Journal of Political Science* testing people's replication packages, it is that authors should **never** transcribe numbers from their statistical software into their papers by hand. This was _easily_ the largest source of replication issues we encountered, as doing so introduced two types of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Mis-transcriptions:** Humans just aren't built to reliably transcribe dozens of numbers by hand. If the error is in the last decimal place, it doesn't mean much, but when a decimal point drifts, or a negative sign is dropped, the results are often quite substantively important.\n",

    "\n",

    "So, how do you avoid this problem? Use tools that will directly export your results into plain text or formatted tables you can use in the program where you are working. For example, `statsmodels` in Python [can export regression tables to lots of formats](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.iolib.table.SimpleTable.html#statsmodels.iolib.table.SimpleTable), [R has stargazer](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stargazer/versions/5.2.2/topics/stargazer), and Stata has [estout](http://repec.org/bocode/e/estout/esttab.html).\n",

For example, to put a single number into $\\LaTeX$, you just generate the number you want to put in your paper, convert it to a string, and save it to disk as a `.tex` file (e.g., `exported_statistic.tex`). Then, in your paper, simply add a `\\input{exported_statistic.tex}`call, and LaTeX will insert the contents of that `.tex` file verbatim into your paper.\n",

    "While this type of integration works best for LaTeX, it can still be accomplished with many other programs like Word. For example, most packages that generate `.tex` files that can be easily integrated into LaTeX also often have options to export to `.txt` or `.rtf` files that you can easily use in Word. These tools can be used to generate tables that can either be (a) copied whole-cloth into Word by hand (minimizing the risk of mis-transcriptions that may occur when typing individual values) or (b) using Word's [Link to Existing File](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Insert-an-object-in-Word-or-Outlook-8fc1ea53-0e01-4603-a4cf-98c49b6ea3f5) feature to connect your Word document to the output of your code in a way that ensures the Word doc loads the most recent version of the table every time Word is opened. Some great tips for combining R with Word [can be found here](http://stanford.edu/~ejdemyr/r-tutorials/tables-in-r/).\n",
