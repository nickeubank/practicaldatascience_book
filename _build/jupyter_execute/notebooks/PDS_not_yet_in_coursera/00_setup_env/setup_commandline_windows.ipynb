    "In our next reading on [Command Line Basics](command_line_part1.ipynb), we'll learn that there are actually several programs available that allow users to interact with their operating system via text commands instead of using their mouse to click on icons (feel free to follow the link and read ahead if you'd like). \n",

    "In this course, we'll focus on learning `bash` because it's so ubiquitous in the data science space. Why? Mostly because it is the default command line tool for Linux operating systems, and while you may not know it, *most* of the computers you interact with on a daily basis run Linux. Your personal computer may be a Mac (which also uses `bash` by default) or a Windows computer, but the computers running websites, managing your email, running those ticket kiosk you see at the airport, etc. are almost all running on Linux. So when you start doing cloud computing, you'll *probably* be working with a Linux virtual machine. So if you're going to learn a command line tool as a data scientist, `bash` is the natural choice.\n",

    "   2. Click on that down-arrow next to the `+` on the tab bar. \n",

    "   7. Save.\n",
