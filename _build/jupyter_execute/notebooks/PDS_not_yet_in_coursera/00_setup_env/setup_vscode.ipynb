That's not because we necessarily because we think it's \"the objectively best editor\"—what editor is best for an individual depends a lot on their own background, programming style, and work flow!— but rather because we think it's a good fit for most students. Moreover, by all supporting the same editor, we can help you get *really good* with VS Code—not everyone will agree VS Code is the best editor, but I think all data scientists will agree that getting really good with *an* editor is an important skill!\n",

To activate this, type `Command-Shift-P` (Mac) or `Control-Shift-P` (Windows) and start typing `Python: Select Interpreter` until that text is selected, then type enter. Then select the version of Python in your `miniconda3` directory (it should say `conda` in grey on the left as well). Provided you're doing this after initially installing your Python extensions, VS Code will treat this as your *default* Python interpreter whenever new Python files are opened (you can also set this manually by directly adding the path to your conda install in the settings, as discussed below).\n",

    "\n",

For example, if you look at your JSON file now, it will probably look something like this, containing only the settings you've modified so far since installing VS Code (namely: your color theme and the path to your default Python interpreter):\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to emphasize that these interfaces *are two sides of the same coin*, and over time you will want to become comfortable with both. The GUI interface is the place you go when you aren't sure what options are provided by an extension, or you aren't sure how an extension's preferences work, while other times you'll just want to make quick changes in the more succinct JSON file."

    "### Format on Save with Black Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "The first setting I'm going to recommend is to turn on \"Format on Save\" for your Python files. When active, any time you save your `.py` file, VS Code will run a program that formats your code so that it is consistent with a specific set of style guidelines. For example, suppose you have a file that looks like this—no spacing between operators, use of single quote quotation marks (`'`) when not required, and a function signature that's so long that it runs off the edge of your window. With format on save activated, as soon as you type `Command-S`, it will be restructured in a clean, deterministic fashion:\n",
    "\n",
    "![format on save gif](images/vscode_formatter_demonstration.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? In short, because humans are really good at *visual pattern recognition*, and so the more that the *visual formatting* of our code reflects the *underlying logic it embodies*, the more likely we are to notice when we make mistakes (which are *inevitable* — a topic we'll return to in a [later reading](../20_programming_concepts/defensive_programming.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in particular, we are going to modify three settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Turn on `Editor: Format on Save`\n",
    "- Turn on `Notebook: Format on Save` (this ensures that Format on Save is also enabled for Jupyter Notebooks. If you don't know what those are, don't worry — we'll talk about them soon!)\n",
    "- Set the default formatter for Python to the Microsoft Black Formatter Extension. (VS Code doesn't *need* this extension to format files, but it formats files much faster than if you don't use the extension, so I strongly recommend using it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![changing format settings gif](images/vscode_formatter_settings.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done, you may find it interesting to look at your `settings.json` file just to see how these settings have been recorded. It should look roughly like this:\n",

    "![settings JSON with formatter](images/vscode_settings_json_post_formatter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is \"Black\"? [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an \"opinionated code formatter.\" As they say on their website \"By using Black, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.\" It's become the standard for formatting Python code, not necessarily because everyone thinks the way it styles codes is \"the best,\" but rather because it's put an end to fights over code format that used to arise in every open-source project. The name for the package comes from a quotation from Henry Ford, who once said of the first mass produced automobile, the Model T, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.\"\n"
