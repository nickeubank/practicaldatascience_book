    "Today, we will continue to work with dask, but this time using much larger datasets. This means that (a) doing things incorrectly may lead to your computer crashing (So save all your open files before you start!), and (b) many of the commands you are being asked run will take several minutes each. \n",

However, to strike a balance between size and speed, we'll be working with a slightly thinned version that has only the last two years of data, instead of all six."

With real world messy data one of the biggest problems with dask is that it struggles if halfway through dataset it discovers that the column it *thought* was floats contains text. That's why, in the dask reading, [I specified the column type for so many columns](https://nickeubank.github.io/practicaldatascience_book/notebooks/PDS_not_yet_in_coursera/30_big_data/70_dask.html#what-can-dask-do-for-me) as `objects` explicitly.
