    "\n",
    "We will start with demographic data from the US Census Bureau. In particular, we'll be working with data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) from 2019-2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike \"The\" decennial US census, which is conducted once every ten-years and aims to ask questions of every American, the ACS is a survey of a sample of Americans run regularly. Unlike the decennial US census, which primarily aims to count all Americans and collect some basic demographic information, the ACS asks questions about all sorts of outcomes, like income, employment, education, health, etc. As a result, it is the main dataset commonly used by researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the ACS is run annually, we will be working with a 5-year sample, in which data from all the surveys conducted between 2019 and 2023 have been pooled. This is done for two reasons. The first is that this pooling results in more statistical power for analyzing things we aren't worried change a lot from year to year. But the bigger reason is that the US Census Bureau worries a *lot* about privacy, and will never release data they think could result in information about the specific individuals who answered the survey to be determined. Historically, they would prevent this by aggregating data before release, where the amount of aggregation was chosen to ensure enough individuals contribute to each data point that the data isn't leaking information about specific individuals. And because the 5-year sample has more people in it, the Census Bureau can provide more granular data without concern that the data will leak information.\n",
